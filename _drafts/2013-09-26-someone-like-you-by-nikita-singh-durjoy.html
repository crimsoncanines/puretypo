The title of the book is very simple and nice. Nothing like the funny oxymoron titles he gives to his book. Well, I would prefer "of course I love you...till I find someone better" or "oh yes I am single... and so is my girlfriend". But someone like you also worked fine with me. the cover-page is oh-so-boring!!&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-size: 14px;">The book is about three friends and their life together in the hostel of an engineering college. Niharika is a typical nerd whose motto in life has been to excel in her studies and enter IIT, making her parents proud. she misses IIT but joins ICE in Nagpur. She is forced to go through a makeover by her sister before she joins her college so that she is the best looking girls on the campus. She meets Tanmay while on the station looking for a taxi and they become best friends since then. Niharika belongs to a typical middle-class family for which having a 15-year-old esteem car is a luxury. Therefore when she meets her roommate Pia, its like she has entered a fairy tale. Pia is a spoilt rich girl. But very sweet and down to earth all the same. The three become best friends. life changes when Akshat decides to come back in Niharika's life and makes her life difficult. Niharika is stuck between Akshat, who her sister has warned her to stay away from and Karthik, who's cockiness drives Niharika mad.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-size: 14px;">The story revolves around these two guys who hate to see each other. there is a lot of emotions in the book. It covers the usual college stuff like the crush, the first time drinking and proposing to a girl, the college football team, the ragging, the college brawl etc.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-size: 14px;">The book seemed extremely boring in the first half. It hardly holds you attention. The story starts getting interesting when Karthik enters the scenario. He is the strong character in the book. The narration is in first person which did not appeal to me in the beginning, but I got used to it later.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-size: 14px;">The book overall is an enjoyable read. But not Durjoy Datta's best. After reading so many of his book, i am now waiting to be surprised. I would, therefore, give it a three stars. And probably take a break from his writings!! go ahead and read it. but be patient. The story picks up grip only from halfway through. Cheers!!</span></div></div>
