The summary seemed to be very interesting and I had not read a book like this one since a very long time. The book is a psycho thriller based on the lives of two teenage boys who are very different from each other but somehow get together and their lives change. I was very excited when I began reading the book but it somehow did not live up to my expectation. Here is what I think of the book.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Cover-page</b>: the cover-page is nothing great. It gives you an idea of being a thriller but that is it. There is no factor which draws you towards the book. It could have been much much better. But I still decided not to judge the book by its cover.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Characters</b>: the book is about two teenage boys. Zach is the school stud boy. All the girls like him. He scores well. He is very rich and drives a mustang. Norman, on the other hand needs to study very hard to score, gets picked up and dropped to school by parents and practically invisible to girls. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Characters are very strong. They are not unique but well portrayed by the author. They keep you interested in the book throughout. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Concept</b>: the concept is very interesting. Its psycho thriller which will keep you glues to the book throughout.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Story line</b>: Zach has everything in life but there are things that nobody knows about him. He is a psycho killer who is identifies a brother in Norman. He wants Norman to be like him. Norman on the other hand is unaware of all these secrets. He just wants to be friends with Zach and have some social life. Both of them become good friends till they realize one is not what the other is looking for. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Language</b>: language is very simple and to the point. The style of writing is also very detailed and interesting. It is no classic but a good story book. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Good points</b>: good concept. Strong characters. Interesting storyline.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Not-so-good points</b>: just as it happens always, the book fails to keep up with your expectations when it comes to the end. The end is very abrupt and without a thunder which one would expect it to be. Shear disappointment towards the end.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><b>Overall</b>: well, should you read it or not? For me a good end is as important as a good story line. I would hate to read a book which does not have a clean end. Thriller lovers are going to hate the book too. I would not recommend this to them. Shall give it 2 and half on 5.</div></div></div>
