This book seemed like an interesting love story to read. The genre I had not touched in a long time. Therefore I picked up the book and started reading immediately. I did not have to wait too long to finish this book since it is a very short read. One can easily finish it in 3 hours. Here is what I think about the book. <br /><br /><br /><b>Cover-page:</b>&nbsp;cover page is very romantic and in the mood. It is not like mannequins sitting and posing. One can see a lot of heat on the cover-page which works well for the book. <span class="apple-converted-space">It is very refreshing to not see a dead pan look on the cover-page. Nice. </span><br /><br /><b>Characters:</b>&nbsp;the book is a story of Michelle. She is a girl who has only met men who have abused her. She runs away from one man and lands with another only to be treated like a trash bag. The male lead is Lars who does not have a good job but he is the gentleman that every girl dreams of. There is also Danielle. Michelleâ€™s lunatic ex-boyfriend. </span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #181818;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /><b>Concept:&nbsp;</b>there is a girl who suffers a lot in her life and is running away from a very bad experience which keeps haunting her. She meets a boy who really respects her and gives her the security that she <span class="apple-converted-space">security that she desires only to be stalked by her abusive ex-boyfriend over and over again. </span><br /><br /><b>Story line:</b>&nbsp;the story is very slow in the beginning. It is devoid of any emotion. One might eventually start getting bored of this. But the book picks up pace from the second half. The chemistry between the lead characters is amazing. The author can write emotions very well. That is for sure. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #181818;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /><b>Language:</b>&nbsp;the language is very simple and easy to understand. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #181818;"><br /><b>Good points:</b>&nbsp;the book is a good love story. It has a good flow. The characters are designed pretty well. A good read for romantic souls. </span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #181818;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /><b>Not-so-good points:</b>&nbsp;the book is very boring in the beginning. It will put the readers to sleep. And when it finally picks the pace the book is already reaching the end. <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Overall:</b>&nbsp;the book is a good read for those who like reading romance. But others might find it very boring. The book is first in the trilogy. I will definitely pick up the second book, but just to know what happens next. A fair attempt. </span></span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></div></div></div>
