And it was not all that great. The cover is very catty. Which does not go with the story inside at all. Also the title fails to attract attention. Then why did I pick it up?? I will have to figure it out before I tell you!!<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The story is about a girl who has a cynical and abusive father. She is forced to keep the happy family image outside but is not doubt choking inside. Her father is one of the richest so she can’t even do anything about it. I liked it this far.... then the little princess decides to do something with her life and stand on her own feet. Great!! There is nobody to help her against her father's wishes but once person. Her father's business rival. Now the story starts getting boring.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">As it happens she falls in love with her father's worst enemy. He rescues her from her father and a happy ending!! well also the clichéd having a dark past and keeping away from relationships and all that jazz from the man's side and stupidly in love and over-expectation from the girl's side. Yes that's the gist of the story.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If I have to judge the book I would say it started very well in the beginning. Sarah Morgan has portrayed emotions really well. Only the sex feels like you are reading a science experiment!! The story goes on to get boring and mindless. The female lead is a breath of fresh air. A lot could have been done with the character like that. He male lead is boring and clichéd, totally.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The book in all is an okayish read. Will not recommend it if you expects a lot from a love story. But it’s a good "pop corn" read. Read it and forget it. It will give it two and half stars.</span></span></div></div></div>
