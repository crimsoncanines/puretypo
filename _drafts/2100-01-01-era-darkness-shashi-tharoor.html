What is the relationship between a colonizer and a colonist?
What is the bending moment of a state which has been looted, plundered,
enslaved and broken? How much self-worth is left when it breaks and strengthens
to rise and raised to ground again? Those who rise above the ashes to fly
beyond have nothing to thank the fire for. <o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
How many times have you met an anglophile who credits the
British for the ‘goods’ of the state? The discipline and the army they have to
thank for or even the great colleges they set up. Railways and ground mapping
always come into the humiliating alms that British threw at us when they left.
But is it really so? Shashi Tharoor, a respectable historian, sheds some
light on the ‘Era of Darkness’ that we have been through to become of the
fastest growing countries in the world.<o:p></o:p></div>

This book is for all those who want to know the past of
India to not ask for revenge but to move forward in peace knowing their
troubled past.<o:p></o:p></div>
