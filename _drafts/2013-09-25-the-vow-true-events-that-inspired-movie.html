But then it got lost among all the other love stories I had in my collection of e-books. One fine day while going through the book list I rarely visit, I came across the book. contemporary love stories that are written these days do not have the charm of "LOVE STORY" by Eric Segal. This one looked different. I immediately picked this one up and started reading.</span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;">The book's title is very very simple and interesting. "the Vow" as a lot of meaning in itself. The cover-page might not be very different from what you see on other love stories.</span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;">The book is about Kim Carpenter and Krickitt Carpenter who fall in love through telephone conversations. When they get comfortable with telephone conversations they decide to meet. And eventually they get married. Life seemed to be a bed of roses until 2 months after their wedding their car meets with an accident with Krickitt suffering severe brain injury. Doctors work hard on her but can only save her life. She goes into coma (almost vegetative state). She remembers every detail of her life but&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;about what happened in last one and half years of her life. Kim is also injured physically but that doesn't stop him from staying up to monitor every progress of his wife. The story is about how Kim and her managed to get over the trauma and start a new life.</span></span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;">The story a very inspiring. their are two people who are pathetically in love with each other. But life takes a sudden turn and everything happy and nice is taken away from them just after two months of their wedding. Kim is ever strong and helps his wife to overcome the trauma, all the way praying and waiting for her to get better. The ever piling up bills and excruciating physical pain weakens Kim but for him divorce has never been an option. He took a vow to be there for his wife for better or for worst and he plans to keep it. Krickitt on the other hand does not remember any vows but people tell her that she is married to Kim. And that is enough for her to keep her vows too. During their testing times they never lose their faith in God. They trust him and ask him to lead their way.</span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;">The book is not a literary miracle. but story is nothing less than that. the events you may find to be jumbled here and there. It affects the sequence of events. the narration is very simple. the story is short and has its impact.</span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;">It is a good read for people who give up too soon, or are loosing faith in the institution of marriage, or even God. also for those who think a brain injury is stops people form living a simple life. The book has a lot to offer to the readers. I would give it four stars. Go ahead and read it. You will not be disappointed. Leaving you with a message from the book.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;">“God hasn't forgotten you, God will never forget you. He says He will never leave you comfortless, and He won't. You can't use Him up or wear Him out. Hang on to him. He wont forget you. So please don't forget Him.”</span></nobr></div><div class="row" style="background-color: white;"><nobr class="greyText"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;"><br /></span></nobr></div><div class="row" style="background-color: white;"><nobr class="greyText"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;">cheers!!</span></nobr></div></div>
