The second in the marriage series. Well, the title is not at all catchy. You might even forget what it said when you go ahead to read you next book. The cover-page also fails to hold much attention. It makes me wonder whether the cover-page design is not considered important or do they just do a pathetic job at it. I can go ahead and give a lesson on how important is the cover-page for a book, but, well, lets save it for the next time.....</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book is about Maggie Alexa's (female lead in the previous book in the series) best friend and now sister-in-law. Maggie is a single, independent working woman. She believes she is not&nbsp;destined&nbsp;to settle in life and have a family like most other women do. And she is not liking it. She likes seeing her brother and Alexa having a happy family together and wants to do everything she can to keep it that way. Her major threat in her unspoken resolve is Micheal. Micheal is the male lead in the story who Maggie believes is in love with her brother's wife-Alexa. Maggie is determined to keep him away from her. that is when Micheal comes to her with a proposition. A proposition that he would stay away from Alexa but in exchange she will have to pretend to be his wife to his family for a week, in Italy. Meeting his family in Italy Maggie realizes how much she was craving for this in her life. While they are together in Italy they share their dark pasts and find solace in each other. A few complicated situations and a happy ending!!</span></span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Well, i was not very happy reading the book myself. The story line is not very innovative. The lead characters are not strong enough. The book is lacking of the moments which Jennifer probst is actually good at creating. Since its a love-story i was expecting it to have few of those moments. But it was a disappointment. There is nothing in a book that makes you miss it. You would happily say goodbye to it and jump at another book in your self!!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">I cannot give the book more that two stars. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I would probably take a break from love stories for sometime!! And ya, come back to read the third book in the series with a fresh mind, not letting the previous book affect me.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">If you guys are still going ahead and reading then best of luck!! let me know what you think!! cheers!</span></div></div>
