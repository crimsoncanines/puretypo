I'd come across this title back in 2016 when I chanced upon a site about the "Most compelling read of 2016". When I was one among the winners of the Goodreads Giveaway of this book, I was thrilled! While I waited for the book, I went through the reviews of the book on Goodreads. At the time of checking, the book had 270 five-star ratings, out of 274.

Sure enough, after some days of eagerly waiting, I received the book, and I started reading it. And the journey began.

### Cover page

The cover page, when I saw it for the first time, disappointed me. It's an image of an urban-looking girl surrounded by bank notes (2000-rupee "specimens", too), and two strips running across as though they were the "Crime scene; do not cross" tapes, albeit with the text, "The First Trillionai₹e". The authors' names are too small.

Not one of the most thrilling covers, I had to admit. But let's not judge the book just by its cover.

### Characters

The story primarily revolves around Shail, the protagonist, of course. There are a myriad of characters in the book, but nobody apart from Shail, other than perhaps Shail's mother, have been delved into. There are Shail's mother; Vanashree, Vanashree's brother, Kran; Shail's grandmother, Olivia, and so on, but the focus never really leaves Shail.

The authors have attempted to bring some depth in a few other characters with some description added, but somehow, the attempt feels half-hearted, and a failure on the whole. But again, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

### Content

The story begins well. Well-begun is half-done. And&hellip; I wish I could say more. With all the hype given on the site, and looking at the high ratings, and going through reviews on various other sites, I felt that Harper Lee had reincarnated. But now I have just lost the little hope I had on the longevity of the world of literature. Goodreads has perhaps done its part in fixing the ratings&mdash;I see only some 40&nbsp;ratings now.

We've seen books adapted into movies; this was the other way around. A Bollywood movie converted into a book. Ekta Kapoor?

> If I have to save my child then I have to win a world war.

This part tempts me to no end.

> <p>'Vaishno Mata will definitely let me ride a scooty very soon.'</p><p>Some girls shook their heads and beckoned her along&hellip; By the time they went downstairs, a girl in a very formal dress approached her.</p><p>'Madam, your scooty is here. I will teach you how to ride, and in an hour you will get a learner's license if you feel ready&hellip;'</p><p>'Madam, you and your friends can accompany us in the limousine waiting outside. It can accommodate you all, and if the need arises, we have a spare one standing outside,' the formal suited girl continued.</p>

### Language

I kept in mind that this was a translated work; the work was translated from Hindi. I could understand the language because I know Hindi; many of the sentences were simply literal translation from Hindi. I'm not sure if it was intentional.

Although a few parts of the book felt beautifully crafted, in terms of word choices and overall construct, many parts felt like a Google Translate done on the original work.

> Run as fast as you can and tell Gopal to come here with Dr&nbsp;Narayan. And also go and tell Mr&nbsp;Singh to come here. He stays next to me.

And then, there were some like this:

> Her injured leg was fitted with a contraption which not only fastened her but also could carry all the weapons she needed.

Really? "Fastened her"?

> All the high-tech medical treatment of Henna was done under the guidance of a crazy doctor who served on the Healthcare Committees of Jamal working for handicapped people.

"Crazy doctor"; so convenient.

There were also some strong "commerce" jargons, including referring to companies as "M/S So-and-So". I don't know if this is the beginning of a new trend. Also, I felt that the book assumes knowledge of banking terms and practices on the reader's part. May my ignorance be pardoned, I had to Google some of the things mentioned in the book.

The important point is, many sentences in the book fail in basic grammar: wrong punctuations, wrong use of conjunctions (sometimes even wrong conjunctions), tense mix-up&hellip; I'm surprised this even cleared the front desk before printing.

> Recently, investigators found out that Musa's Dubai-based company, Al Jamal Diamonds, is a front for his illegal trade in blood diamonds. 'On each trip, diamonds worth around $5–10&nbsp;lack are smuggled into Dubai and the African courier is paid $10,&nbsp;000 as his courier fee,' as per the report.

My high school grammar class tells me, there are _at least_ three errors in the quoted text.

### Good points

To someone who grew up reading the likes of Champak, this book would be a memory refresher. The language has a "homely narrative" feel to it&mdash;the kind that reminds you of your granny.

In some places, the word patterns seem feminine. I think that's a good thing&mdash;the author's attempt to retain the feel of how the author of the original work (Mrs Sapna Jha in this case) wrote it.

### Bad points

I'm sorry to say this, but oh, where do I even begin?

The book could use some (read: at least two rounds each, of basic and substantive) editing. It felt as though the manuscript was simply printed. Verbatim.

There was no uniformity in the visual language. In some places, a scene break is shown using a blank line (which is confusing given the paragraph separation style chosen by the the printers), while in others, there are three asterisks (which should've been followed throughout, in their case). The book follows no specific style: dialogues are in single quotes (which is a British English feature), but then, commas appear within the quotes even when they're not part of the speech (which is mostly an American English feature). And no, mixing them is _not_ Indian English.

Sentences that are supposed to be things the character is saying to themselves in their head are not differentiated from narration, which confuses the reader.

Inter-word spaces are missing in many places. Even the most basic word processing software has a spell check feature which can identify these errors!

Chapter names are supposed to appetise the reader. Here, some of the chapter names seem like author's notes on their storyboard.

At some point, things got to a level where I just wanted to stop reading and mark it "DNF" here, in the review; I stuck on just because I did not want my first review to be a DNF.

And then there's typography.

> It's a book; show some respect.

Today, book typography is conveniently&mdash;and blatantly&mdash;ignored. This book is probably the greatest testimony to that.

It seems as though the publishing house simply fired up Word&nbsp;1993, copy-pasted the contents of the manuscript, ran a cursory spelling and grammar check (finishing the process in precisely three minutes), changed the body font to a random font that was available on www.1001freefonts.com, without even checking the character spacing&hellip; did everything that should not be done to a book, including taking the time to format the chapter title in a bold, all-caps, sans-serif font (whew).

And then there's more:

- Text justification is turned on without hyphenation, thereby making the word spacing (horrendously) uneven.
- There are page numbers on pages where chapters begin.
- The text is sagging&mdash;the top margin is more than the bottom one, with the page numbers cramped somewhere in the limited space.
- The text blocks on the spread don't align. I'm guessing this is because Word decided to avoid widows and orphans by forcing content to the next pages.
- There's *emphasis like this*, and then, there's __*emphasis on emphasis like this*__. I suddenly felt I was reading a government circular, where they were very generous in the use of the "Bold" *and* "Italics" formatting controls. I'm thankful they didn't add an underline, where they wanted __*<u>further emphasis</u>*__, or a __*<u>LITTLE MORE</u>*__. I think that was just luck, because I don't see where the need might've arisen in this book.
- There's so much more, but I don't want to sound like a picky grandpa. I'll stop by saying, 'It's a book; show some respect.'

### Overall

Abysmal.

I see that this review is just the opposite of what seems to be common perspective, but I promised the author an honest review; I'm just keeping my word.

### Whom do I recommend this to

Nobody.

This book has to go through a round of drastic corrections before it can be considered a professional publication. I understand a first-time-writer has his issues, but this is just sloppy work. If only the publishers read this post and considered making amends.
