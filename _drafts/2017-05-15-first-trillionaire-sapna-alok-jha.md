I'd come across this title back in 2016 when I chanced upon a site about the "Most compelling read of 2016". When I was one among the winners of the Goodreads Giveaway of this book, I was thrilled! While I waited for the book, I went through the reviews of the book on Goodreads. At the time of checking, the book had 270 five-star ratings, out of 274.

Sure enough, after some days of eagerly waiting, I received the book, and I started reading it. And the journey began.

### Cover page

The cover page, when I saw it for the first time, disappointed me. It's an image of an urban-looking girl surrounded by bank notes (2000-rupee "specimens", too), and two strips running across as though they're the 'Crime scene; do not cross' tapes, albeit with the text, "The First Trillionaiâ‚¹e". The authors' names are too small.

Not one of the most thrilling covers, I had to admit. But let's not judge the book just by its cover.

### Characters

The story primarily revolves around Shail, the protagonist, of course. There are a myriad of characters in the book, but nobody apart from Shail, other than perhaps Shail's mother, have been delved into. There are Shail's mother; Vanashree, Vanashree's brother, Kran; Shail's grandmother, Olivia, and so on, but the focus never really leaves Shail.

The authors have attempted to bring some depth in a few other characters with some description added, but somehow, the attempt feels half-hearted, and a failure on the whole. But again, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

### Content

The story begins well. Well-begun is half-done. And&hellip; I wish I could say more. With all the hype given on the site, and looking at the high ratings, and going through reviews on various other sites, I felt that Harper Lee had reincarnated. But now I have just lost the little hope I had on the longevity of the world of literature.

We've seen books adapted into movies; this was the other way around. A Bollywood movie converted into a book&mdash;a Rajnikanth movie, perhaps.

### Language

I kept in mind that this was a translated work; the work was translated from Hindi. I could understand the language because I know Hindi; many of the sentences were simply literal translation from Hindi. I'm not sure if it was intentional.

Although a few parts of the book felt beautifully crafted, in terms of word choices and overall construct, many parts felt like a Google Translate done on the original work.

There were also some strong "commerce" jargons, including referring to companies as "M/S So-and-So". I don't know if this is the beginning of a new trend. Also, I felt that the book assumes that the reader knows banking terms and practices. May my ignorance be pardoned, I had to Google some of the things mentioned in the book.

The important point is, many sentences in the book fail in basic grammar: wrong punctuations, wrong use of conjunctions (sometimes even wrong conjunctions), tense mix-up&hellip; I'm surprised this even cleared the front desk before printing.

### Good points

To someone who's grown reading the likes of Champak, this book would be a memory refresher. The language has a "homely narrative" feel to it&mdash;the kind that reminds you of your granny.

In some places, the word patterns seem feminine. I think that's a good thing&mdash;the author's attempt to retain the feel of how the author of the original work (Mrs Sapna Jha in this case) wrote it.

### Bad points

I'm sorry to say this, but where do I even begin?

The book could use some (read: at least two rounds each, of basic and substantive) editing. It felt as though the manuscript was simply printed. Verbatim.

There was no uniformity in the visual language. In some places, a scene break is shown using a blank line (which is confusing given the paragraph separation style chosen by them), while in others, there are three asterisks (which should've been followed throughout, in their case). The book follows no specific style: dialogues are in single quotes (which is a British English feature), but then commas appear within the quotes even when they're not part of the speech (which is mostly an American English feature). Sentences that are supposed to be things the character is saying to themselves in their head are not differentiated from narration, which confuses the reader.

Inter-word spaces are missing in many places. Even the most basic word processing software has the spell check feature which can identify these errors!

Chapter names are supposed to appetise the reader. Here, some of the chapter names seem like author's notes on their storyboard.

At some point, things got to a level where I just wanted to stop reading and mark it "DNF" here, in the review, but I stuck on just because I did not want my first review to be a DNF.

### Overall

Abysmal.

I understand that this review is just the opposite of what seems to be common perspective, but I promised the author an honest review; I'm just keeping my word.

### Typography

> It's a book; show some respect.

My field day begins. Today, book typography is conveniently ignored. This book is the greatest testimony to the fact.

It seems as though the publishing house simply fired up Word&nbsp;1993, copy-pasted the contents of the manuscript, ran a cursory spelling and grammar check (finishing the process in precisely three minutes), changed the body font to a random font that's available on www.1001freefonts.com, without even checking the character spacing&hellip; did everything that should not be done to a book, including taking the time to format the chapter title in a bold, all-caps, sans-serif font (whew).

And then there's more:

- Text justification is turned on without hyphenation, thereby making the word spacing (horrendously) uneven.
- There are page numbers on pages where chapters begin.
- The text is sagging&mdash;the top margin is more than the bottom, with the page numbers cramped somewhere at the bottom.
- The text blocks on the spread don't align. I'm guessing this is because Word decided to avoid widows and orphans by forcing content to the next pages.
- There's more, but I don't want to sound like a picky grandpa. I'll stop by saying, 'It's a book; show some respect.'

### Whom do I recommend this to

Nobody.

This book has to go through a round of drastic corrections before it can be considered a professional publication. I understand a first-time writer has his issues, but this is simply sloppy work. I wish the publishers read this post and consider making amends.
