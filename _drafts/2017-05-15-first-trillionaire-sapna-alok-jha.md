I'd come across this book back in 2016 when I chanced upon a site about the "Most compelling read of 2016". When I was one among the winners of the Goodreads Giveaway, I was thrilled! While I waited for the book, I went through the reviews of the book on Goodreads. At the time of checking, the book had 270 five-star ratings, out of 274.

Sure enough, after some days of eagerly waiting, I received the book in a few days, and I started reading the book. And then it all started.

### Cover page

The cover page, when I saw it for the first time, disappointed me. It's an image of an urban-looking girl surrounded by bank notes, and two strips running across as though they're the 'Crime scene; do not cross' tapes. The authors' names are too small.

Not one of the most thrilling covers in any sense. But I didn't judge the book by its cover. I moved on.

### Characters

The story primarily revolves around Shail, the protagonist, obviously. There are a myriad of characters in the book, but nobody apart from Shail, other than perhaps Shail's mother, have been delved into. There are Shail's mother; Vanashree, Vanashree's brother, Kran; Shail's grandmother, Olivia, and so on, but the focus never really leaves Shail.

The authors have attempted to bring some depth in a few other characters, but somehow, the attempt feels half-hearted, and a failure on the whole.

### Content

The story begins well. Well-begun is half-done. And the content, in the end, feels half-baked. It disappointed me. With all the hype given on the site, and looking at the high ratings, I felt Harper Lee had reincarnated. But now I have just lost the little hope I had on the longevity of the world of literature.

We've seen books adapted into movies; this was the other way around. A Bollywood movie converted into a book&mdash;a Rajnikanth movie, perhaps; that's what it seemed like.

### Language

I kept in mind that this was a translated work; the work was translated from Hindi. And knowing Hindi, I could understand the language; many of the sentences were simply literal translation from Hindi. I'm not sure if it was intentional.

Although a few parts of the book felt beautifully crafted, in terms of word choices and overall construct, many parts felt like a Google Translate done on the original work.

There were also some strong "commerce" jargons, including referring to companies as "M/S So-and-So". I don't know if this is the beginning of a new trend. Also, I felt that the book assumes that the reader would know banking terms and practices. I didn't. I had to Google some of the things mentioned in the book.

Many sentences failed in basic grammar. The punctuations were wrong, the flow was substandard. It was a disappointment.

### Good points

To someone who's grown reading the likes of Champak, this book would refresh some of those memories. The language has a "homely narrative" feel to it&mdash;the kind that reminds you of your granny.

In some places, the word patterns seem feminine. I think that's a good thing&mdash;the author's attempt to retain the feel of how the author of the original work (Ms Sapna Jha in this case) wrote it.

### Bad points

I'm sorry to say this, but where do I even begin?

The book could use some (read: at least two rounds each, of basic and substantive) editing. It felt as though the manuscript was simply printed.

There was no uniformity in style. In some places, the scene shift is shown using a blank line (which is confusing given the paragraph separation style chosen by them), while in others, there are three asterisks (which should've been followed throughout, in their case). The book follows no specific style: dialogues in single quotes (which is a British English feature), but the comma appearing within the quote even when it's not part of the speech (mostly an American English feature). Sentences that are supposed to be things the character is saying to him/herself are not differentiated from narration, which adds to confusion.

Inter-word spaces are missing in many places. Even the most basic word processing software has the spell check feature which can identify this!

Chapter names are supposed to appetise the reader. Here, some of the chapter names just give away what's inside.

Many parts of the story are highly predictable.

At some point, things got to a level where I just wanted to stop reading and mark it "DNF" here in the review, but I stuck on because I did not want my first review to be a DNF.

### Overall

Abysmal.

It pains me that 270 out of 274 reviewers would give this piece of work a five-star rating. I felt appalled by the level to which readers could stoop. I felt Chetan Bhagat was terrible. Today, I stand corrected.

### Typography

Today, book typography is conveniently ignored. This book is testimony to the fact.

It seems as though the publishing house simply fired up Word&nbsp;1993, copied the content from the manuscript, ran a cursory spelling and grammar check (finishing the process in precisely three minutes), changed the body font to something that's available on `1001fonts.com`, without even checking character spacing (or leading for that matter)&hellip; did everything that should not be done in a book, including taking the time to format the chapter title in a bold, all-caps, sans-serif font (whew).

And then there's more:

- Text justification is turned on without hyphenation, thereby making the word spacing (terribly) uneven.
- Page numbering on pages where chapters begin.
- The text is sagging&mdash;the top margin is more than the bottom.
- The type areas on the spread don't align. I'm guessing this is because Word decided to avoid widows and orphans by forcing content to the next pages.
- There's more, but I don't want to sound like a picky grandpa. I'll stop here.

### Whom do I recommend this to

Nobody.

This book has to go through a round of drastic corrections before it can be considered a professional publication. I understand a first-time writer has his issues, but this is simply lazy work. I wish the publishers read this post and consider making amends.
