Now how do I review it when I am so floored??!! Well, let me give it a try!!</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I came across this book randomly. Was seeing it in everyone's shelf and I said "I will read it someday. Someday when I am in a mood to digest philosophy." the thing about philosophical books is that they are very deep, need a lot of concentration and well, they are difficult to follow. I personally hate a book of philosophy book. The quick fixes are hard to digest and end of the day you realize you just spent a fortune on a book which you will probably never follow.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The monk who sold his Ferrari is a breath of fresh air. It not only enriches your soul but also gives you a direction. The book is about two lawyers, Julian and John. Julian has an amazing practice but one fine day while arguing in the court he suffers heart attack. John, his subordinate prays for his good health and for him to come and take care of the practice. He gets well alright but does not return to practice. He instead sells all his belongings which includes a Ferrari and sets out for Himalayas with not material possessions. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">While on his journey he meets the monks of Sivan in Himalayas and gathers the gyan of how to lead a wonderful life. He returns with all the knowledge that he has gathered and spreads it around everywhere, starting with John.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The book promises a lot of things. It is an enlightenment for those who wish they could lead a better life but do not know where to start from. The writing is very simple and entertaining. There are a number of quotes and fables in the book which support each and every philosophy. John tries to be funny every now and then but it is not very effective. There are also a number of quick fixes which promise to change your course of life forever. As I already said I do not like books that offer quick fixes. But this one seems believable. I should probably try it sometime. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The book is saturated with a number of philosophy and tricks which are not meant to read but to observe. Therefore one might get bored of reading though it. My suggestion, keep a notebook and jot down everything. Also, do not try to finish the book in one go. It might just leave you too saturated by the end of the day.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div><nobr class="greyText" style="color: #aaaaaa;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">                       </span></nobr><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Overall the book is a very interesting read. It is meant for everyone who needs a positive direction in life. It is well researched and offers more than just quick fixes. I will give these book 4 stars and recommend everyone to read it at least once in their lifetime. Cheers!!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div></div><div style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;"><nobr class="greyText" style="color: #aaaaaa;"></nobr></div></div></div>
