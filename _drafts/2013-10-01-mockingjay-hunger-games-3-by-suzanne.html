The cover page is really boring and the title is no surprise at all. The first book in the series was a pleasant read and second was alright with few things to complain about. The third book named mockingjay takes forward the story of Katniss Everdeen after she escapes the quarter quell arena.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">After being rescued from the quarter quell arena, Katniss is taken to district 12 which is nothing but ashes. The majority of population has been burnt with a few being rescued and transported to district 13. Katniss soon realizes that Peeta could not be saved from the capitol. Her mission is now to rescue Peeta and give a kind of death to president snow which will be forever remembered. In this quest she is now made the face of the rebellion. All the districts have united and a war has been declared against capitol.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The story is VERY slow in the beginning. At few places it is very difficult to digest too. A seventeen years old girl has been declared the face of the war. I still find it difficult to digest. Especially when her role in the war is nothing but to shoot propos. I just got bugged and left the book halfway to read some cheesy romance. Yes!! It is that annoying!! Anyways. The second half of the book gains pace. From here on there are other interesting things to look forward to. Katniss meeting Peeta and swearing to avenge.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Towards the end the book is very engrossing. The story moves fast and the decisions made are split second. The end is not predictable as I was expecting it to be. The last five chapters are very well written. It will keep you hooked to the book, definitely.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I would have rated this book a four but the bored to death beginning does not please me. So I will give it a three. Read it if you must. But it is nothing as compared to the first book in the series.</span></span></div></div></div>
