Ones who have read durjoy datta before would better know that the content of the book is not half as interesting as the title itself. Then why do i go back to his book?? I can explain!!&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">For one, I cannot read two serious books at stretch. So these " pop-corn " books give me a break form the serious "stuff" and I get to enjoy life. secondly, All the famous serious writers I know are going to be good. I can pick up any book by them and I know that I will not regret reading it. On the contrary, the new writers on board are the once not yet discovered. So i feel they should also get a fair chance. After a series of not so good books I thought should explain why I keep going back to them!!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">This is the 7th book I have read by Dujoy Datta. I m not a crazy fan, trust me!!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book is about the love conquests and heartbreaks of the author. For once you might wonder why somebody would be interested in reading about the author's love life. Well, he's cute!! And a young achiever!! hmmm... So when i started the book I was bored to death. Story is supposedly written by Neeti Rustagi, his friend. Durjoy Datta starts from his school crush, goes on to college affairs, to his office and his school of management. He explains himself at every point that he is not a bad person. He is just thoroughly confused about the choices n life! He goes out to find true love every time but it eventually ends up being a fling. And when he finds true love he is a fool enough to let it slip out of his hands. But he is just lucky to get her back and gets his happily ever after.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">For the girls who are interested, I would like to tell you that Durjoy Datta constantly denies that the book is entirely about his life. In his own words, Neeti Rustagi is a good story teller so what she writes should not be believed!!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Durjoy Datta turns out to be a regular character that you would see in your college canteen. It is kept very real in he has not been portrayed as a god in human body. That is what I like about the character. the book is very boring in the beginning. He is a nerd who could hardly grab any girl's attention. The story gets interesting when a new girl called Manika enters his life and he changes for good. The writer ends the book on a very hopeful note that somewhere somebody is made for you. To find him you need to keep bumping into wrong people!! The book is a train journey read. When you finish it you will have a smile on your face. This book again is not a literary wonder by Durjoy Datta. But yet again it does have few good hilarious and emotional moments like every book by the author.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">I would give this book 2 and half - 3 stars. If you are saturated from reading a heavy duty book then this one is the right book you should be reading. Go ahead. give it a try. But do not expect it to be a war and peace!! ciao!!</span></div></div>
