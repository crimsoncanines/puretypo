<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FY8mz3BOgGg/UkJlQzOMDTI/AAAAAAAAABA/ni-mHsiBlpc/s1600/10322314.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FY8mz3BOgGg/UkJlQzOMDTI/AAAAAAAAABA/ni-mHsiBlpc/s1600/10322314.jpg" height="320" width="206" /></a></div><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 18px;">Published by Srishti&nbsp;</span><nobr class="greyText" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 18px;">(first published January 1st 2010)</nobr></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><nobr class="greyText" style="background-color: clear; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 18px;"><br /></nobr></span><span style="background-color: clear; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The bookâ€™s title is an interesting one. Definitely catches the attention of the readers. Going by the cover page you do not expect a lot from it. One would expect it to be another light read novel that you read on a train journey. It Seems fun but not making an everlasting impression.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The gist of the story given in the last page also fails to hold you attention for too long. It gives one an impression of an ordinary story. The characters are ones you would meet everyday in your college, canteen, discos and pubs.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">In the beginning the story is very slow and not catchy enough. Saumya is transferred to a small village in Karnataka because the human resource department thought her to be a boy. Thanks to her unisex name. Along with her are Amit from her own institute of management and Malappa whom she meets in the township. And no! This is not a love triangle. One would want to give up the book in the beginning. But the story picks up the pace when the character of Shubhro walks in. The story again dies in the middle. Towards the end the story gets interesting when Saumya and Shubro meet once again and spend time together. The end is quite interesting, nothing like one would expect it.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book overall lacks language, style and any skill in writing. Story is the only plus point in the novel. But narration again&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;do justice to the story. I would give the books two. But since the story is offbeat and gets you thinking, I can be generous and give it a three.&nbsp;</span></span></span></div>
