A thick book that it was when it was gifted to me I procrastinated reading it. Also a lot of people had told me before that Dan brown is very predictable. Therefore it directly went to one of those shelves where you go once a year to clean the cupboard.</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="row" style="background-color: white; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 18px;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="color: #555555;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But I am glad I did it.</span><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The third book of Dan brown is called the lost symbol. It was one of the bestsellers in the literal word when it came out. It gathered a huge crowd towards the bookshops.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">I will start by introducing to you the negative character in the book. He definitely takes the cake away! The villain in the book is Ma'lakh, a tall, bald and hulk looking man. His entire body is covered with tattoos of various symbols which have been there in the history of the world, each one meaning something. But there is a square inch of space left in on the soft spot of his head which he saves for a very special purpose. He is looking for a secret symbol which he believes is going to make him the purest of the being making him the most powerful on the earth. The character sketch of mal'akh is extraordinary.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">And of course, the male lead is Robert Langdon, a symbologist who helps or rather forced to help Mal'akh to discover the lost symbol.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The story begins when Robert gets an early morning call from his friend Peter's assistant asking him to deliver a lecture in Washington D.C. Langdon reaches there only to find a tattooed severed hand of his friend. He realizes that he has been called here not by Peter but someone who wants him to do what he asks for if he wants to see his friend alive. The villain takes him around the city discovering different buildings, paintings and symbols.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The book is a mystery spinned on the secrets of the free masons around the world. The description is based on facts and figures and hold true to its words. All the places and persons mentioned in the book are not fictitious at all!!</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The book is written in a very simple language. The characters are very real they keep you glued to the book. The facts and figures force you to Google them once you read them since you find it so hard to believe. The book also talks about neotic science. It a science based of the concept that a human thought is a measurable entity, however small it may be. Also when united by a lot of people it can change the course of the world. And it is scientific. Nothing like a Paulo Coelhoâ€™s philosophy. It is again one of those bits where you would want to watch YouTube videos and read books about. :)</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="color: #555555;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; color: #555555; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/-DgPu2xxVMw/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/-DgPu2xxVMw&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/-DgPu2xxVMw&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #0b5394;"> &nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="color: #0b5394;">the lost symbol movie trailer!!!</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #181818;">I would give this book a 4 n half.
