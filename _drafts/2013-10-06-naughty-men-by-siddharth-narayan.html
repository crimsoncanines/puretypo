And not reached the station just to catch a bus when it was about to leave – lucky. Also not reached home just before it started raining lucky. I am talking about winning 300 bucks in tambola when I was 14 lucky. And we all know how often it happens!! Yeah so this is how lucky I felt when I came across this book. I found this book in reliance timeout. This has been my famous book store chain (sad it is now closing down). The cover looked interesting and I started reading it, and I was laughing my guts out. I did not buy the book then and went around searching for it later with no good luck. Came across this book again in a library and rest is history. Well, it’s coming up!!</span><span style="color: #181818; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><b>Cover page:</b>&nbsp;well, the cover page is fairly good. Just that it looks more like a bollywood movie poster. Still, I am not complaining.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Characters</b>: the lead character is a stereotype man in his 40. He has got everything in life, a degree from IIT, IIM, a job in a renowned company and a happy family. The character is well sketched out and is fun to read. And beware. I m going to use fun in many its forms while writing this review!!<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #181818; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /><b>Concept:</b>&nbsp;the concept of the book is very interesting. The man has got it all but is sex starved. His friend is also in the same situation and they can relate with each other.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #181818; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /><b>Story line:</b>&nbsp;And lately he is in a habit of talking to his nunu, DICK!! He thinks he needs a shrink, a detective and a road trip. The book is a roller coaster ride of laughter that will make you insane. <br /><br /><b>Language:</b> the language is very simple. You will not need to sit with a dictionary in by your side. <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Finally!!<br /><br /><b>Good points: </b>the book is an interesting concept and well executed. The cover page could have been better but I am not complaining. The story is spun very well and all the characters are amazingly unique. <br /><br /><b>Not-so-good points:</b>well, I did not really find any. But I would have loved to read more. Waiting for his next book. <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Overall:</b> overall, the book is a wonderful read. It is for people to sit and enjoy. I would give it a well deserved 5 stars. And recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh. A must read, really. <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></div></div></div>
