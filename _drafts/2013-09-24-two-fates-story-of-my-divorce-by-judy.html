I wanted to try something light and then this book's title hit me instantly.</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book is a story about the narrator's divorce. And as you will guess by the title it is a remake of "two states" by Chetan Bhagat but only in reverse. The male lead is an IIT graduate and wants to become a writer, which apparently is the dream of Deepika Sundar, his wife and literature graduate. The problems keep mounting and finally they decide to get divorced. Throughout the book they struggle to convince their family that they are not really the as perfect couple as their family thinks. The book is a romantic comedy about the two people getting their family divorced too.</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="color: #cccccc;"><span style="background-color: clear;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The lead&nbsp;Characters&nbsp;are really strong and you can identify with them. There is no effort of portraying someone right or wrong. The book is funny and entertaining. The writing style is very different from Chetan bhagat. the book is a good mix of witty sentences and funny instances. but the story line falls weak. T</span></span></span><span style="background-color: clear; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">here are few questions that you might find yourself asking. For example why the hell did they want to get divorced??!! And yeah. Not interested in each other anymore is not a valid reason. And why does Deepika decide to become a shrink when she actually wanted to write all this while and accused Rishab of stealing her dream??&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">While i have totally fallen for the suthor and her writing style, the book is not one of my favorites. Where are many lose ends in the book which is not really appealing. The book overall is a good entertainer and you will finish it with a smile on you face. I will recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh and appreciates good writing. I will give a three on five.</span></div>
