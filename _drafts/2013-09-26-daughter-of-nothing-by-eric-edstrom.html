After going through the gist of the book I knew I had to read it. The amazing book cover is an icing on the cake. After receiving the book from story cartel I could hardly keep myself away from it.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The story is about a group of students in a school far away from the world on an island, who are being trained to lead the men of the world to a better future. Hence they are called scions. The students here believe themselves to be orphans. The students are divided into groups and are lead by an older and more capable leader. Jacey is happy for Sarah now that Sarah has completed her studies and is free to go out and experience the real world. But the uncertainty about what happens to the students who pass out keeps her curious. She goes on to discover the reality behind the act of kindness and it leaves her and many others gasping for air.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The story is a young adult science fiction loosely based on the science of cloning and brain transfer.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">Here is what I think about the book:</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The cover page and the title of the book are very interesting as mentioned earlier. The characters of the book are well designed and one can definitely identify with them. The story line is what will keep one reading the books until one finishes it cover to cover. The book is an unputdownable in true sense (I locked myself in the room an entire weekend to finish this book! Entire weekend!). The characters are very well thought over. Jacey and Socrates are my favorites, no surprise there! But even the negative character of Dr, Carlhagen is very well designed. Overall, I loved the book!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">There are few things that were not well digested by me.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">Firstly, too many grammatical and spelling errors!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">Secondly, the story jumped too quickly from kids in the dorm to girl in a stunning gown to an evil principal to bits and pieces of science fiction and of course the theater like drama towards the end. It can be easily brushed away giving author's creative independence or his style a reason but, well, it was way too difficult for me to take it!</span><br /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">Thirdly, the end is a bit abrupt. I mean after a great build up I was expecting a conclusion kind of ending. You know like the happily ever after kind of ending. There better be a sequel to it! Such an amazing book deserves a fair end!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The book is an absolute delight. I would give it a 4. I recommend it to everyone who wants to break away from the regular thrillers and try something new. This book will not disappoint you!</span><br /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></div></div>
