It&nbsp;portrays&nbsp;the book to be very sensual. But the book is&nbsp;far from it. The book is a simple teenage romance story and the complications that come attached to it. Even though the cover page does not imply what is their in the book it surely takes away all the attention. I just wish there was not much photoshopping done here. otherwise no complains. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Characters:</b> the characters in the book are not far from usual there is robin who is shy, hardly speaks her mind and lets all good things slip away to others. There is Kent who is in love with robin. He tries and fails every time to get robin out of her shell. But the other two characters take the cake away. Ashley is the slut of the school but all she is looking out for true and everlasting love. Partick is in love with Ashley and is waiting for the day when she realizes how much she means to him. Patrick and Ashley are the characters that you are going to hate in the beginning but eventually fall in love with. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Story line:</b> the book is a high school romance and all that it comes with. The author cleverly deals with all the aspects of the romance in the school. There is raw emotion seen everywhere. Which I have come to love. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Concept:</b> concept is not very unique but the way it is carried out is definitely commendable. This book is definitely different from other high school romance that you might have read before.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Language: </b>the language is very simple. One does not need a dictionary to read the book throughout. Not much use of my new kindle but I am not complaining. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Good points:</b> the book is very simple and easy to read. It is not all&nbsp;fairy tale&nbsp;which is a refreshing&nbsp;change in the school romance story.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Bad points:</b> the cover-page is not bad but definitely could have been better. I also found the writing in first person very annoying in the beginning but I got used to it. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444;"><br /></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #444444; font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><b>Overall: </b>It is good for a teenager who is looking for a fun summer read. Even though the book does not fall into my age group I thoroughly enjoyed it. Already started reading the next book in the series.</span></div></div></div>
