I picked up the book because I thought I could use an advice or two about money saving but the good thought ended up in confusion. Here are my ratings for the book in different categories and what I think about them.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><br /><span style="background: white;">Cover-page: cover-page of the book is very descriptive and easy to understand. Even thought it could have been a little more creative, I am not complaining. It works well for me.</span><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">Characters: the book is about a family of four. The lady of the house is facing huge financial problems but the man is not willing to face the situation.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Characters are picked up from day to day life. Tab, the lady is sensible though clueless and Jack, the man is a chicken. The characters are not very interesting. One might relate oneself with the characters but there is no gripping factor in them.</span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">Concept: concept of the book is very interesting. Concept is the sole entity that will make you pick up the book in the first place. The family is facing major financial issues but they do not know how to get out of it. And there comes the advice and all.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">Story line: story-line is nothing great. Or I should say there is not story at all. Tab does not like the meagre wages that she and her husband are making. Same time her friends calls her out for a weekend trip attending some conference. Tab there finds answers to all her questions apparently.</span><br /></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="background: white; color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">Language: the language used is very simple as it happens in all the self help books. It is easy to understand. The writing is very serious.</span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">Good points: good concept. Easy to read.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">Not-so-good points: pathetic story. Emotionless writing. A material less read. No substance in the book at all.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">Overall: the book is not a self help at all. I did not understand how can I spend less and save more except of course save more. This book does not help you solve any of your problems. Just a very simple read. You can probably teach your 6 year old English with it. Otherwise a complete time waste.</span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /></span></div></div>
