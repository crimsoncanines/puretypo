Oh by the way, till now I thought Lemony Snicket is a woman!! :P anyways... the book is definitely much better than the first one. Also very different from the movie.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">The lead characters are again the Baudelaire orphans. Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are to be taken care of by the scientist relative of theirs whom they have heard of for the first time. The children are happy to meet there new guardian. Montgomery Montgomery is a brilliant herpetologist, a word here which means someone who studies about snakes!! I am already catching the language. :P oh also his name is really Montgomery Montgomery. That is not a repetition!!</span><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">Just when they think they are going to live happily ever after, violet inventing new snake traps, Klaus reading about snakes and Sunny biting the pieces of rope, Count Olaf renters into their lives as a disguise. He again tries to steal the Baudelaire fortune but the kids stop him from doing so, although not well before time.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">I was wishing for the Count to go to prison and design his evil plans there but he again flees again. Desperately waiting to find out what happens to the kids next.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">The book is a very interesting read. The lead characters are really powerful. The humor is contained in this book very well. Also the plot is very different. The little explanation about what some of the difficult words mean is very interesting. I am definitely bowled over by the author's style of writing!!</span><br /><br /><span style="background: white;">This is a book is a quick read that will keep you hooked till the end. Canâ€™t wait to catch hold of the next one in the series!!</span></span></div></div>
