It was a long time back and I almost thought she forgot! But a few days back I received an e-mail from her which had this book as an attachment. There was also a note saying I was in no pressure to review it! But well, let’s appreciate good work!</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="color: #555555; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Ryan has done it again! Thrice in a row! Here is my opinion of the book.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.85pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Cover-page</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">: &nbsp;when I received this book I wanted to cry!! Say “why Ryan! Why??!!” Looking at the cover it is very easy for anyone to write this book off saying this must be a regular erotic/romantic book. Only when you hear it from someone who has read previous two books you shall believe that this is not an author to ignore. I am very sorry to say that the cover-page is downright boring! A good romance cover is not just people making out. I would prefer earlier covers over this one any day!</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Characters:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;the characters in this book are the ever to unpopular Josh, the girl he eventually falls for, Becca, Aiden who does not only have a flawed face but a flawed life too and the princess he eventually falls for, someone who may be too good for him.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Story line:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;the story takes a huge leap. The characters are out of their high school and in real life. Josh is the same jerk that he used to be. Just that now he is bored of making out in his Mastang and needs his own place to do all the despicable things he has been doing. He sets out in search of place and eventually finds a flat with Aiden as his roommate. And it is the neighbor that he cannot resist. Aiden’s scarred face has forced him to be nocturnal. At his workplace he meets Jordyn for the first time. As the book introduces the characters it is very difficult to figure who is paired with whom. Which is what I love about Ryan. She does not disclose everything at once and you want to read further to find out.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Concept:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;I loved the concept! I mean who could have thought that Josh would ever become a good boy?! I never did. And this could not have been done better. By anyone else. Ryan has a way with words which can make oil spill in Atlantic also into a blessing!</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Language:&nbsp;</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">the language as always is very simple. It is easy to read and you do not read a dictionary for it. The book is written in all the characters point of view in different stages. Ryan writes emotions very well. And it is seen in this book as well. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Good points:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;there are a number of points that I should love to mention. Ryan has written the book very well. And I do not expect any less from her. The character portrayal is magnificent. The book is about flaw. It is not about a handsome billionaire and a princess of Venice. It feels real. This is what makes it stand out. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Bad points:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;the only bad point about the book is its cover. Needless to say it could have been much better. </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Overall:&nbsp;</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">the book is an amazing read. I would recommend this book to people from all age groups. Especially teenagers. Ryan may warn you saying it contains adult content but I shall still go ahead and give it to all the romance readers just because it is a beautiful book. The ever so perfectionists can learn a thing or two from this book. Signing off as I patiently wait for the author to finish her next book!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div></div></div></div>
