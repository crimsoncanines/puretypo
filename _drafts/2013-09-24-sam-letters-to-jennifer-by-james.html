So i finally decided to give his books a try. Picked this one at random actually. Sam's letters to Jennifer seemed to be a good read for the summary which was given in Goodreads. The title seemed to be like one of the love stories that you read. Also before i forget to mention, before starting a the book I thought Sam to be a guy!! well the cover page is decent. Not very interesting and not very boring.</span></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The story is about Jennifer, who is a columnist in a regional newspaper. When Jennifer loses her husband in a swimming mishap her world crashes. She loses all the hope in the world. Also she blames herself for the mishap. Just when Jennifer thinks her life can no longer get back to normal she gets a phone call from Lake Geneva from the Reverand saying that her grandmother is in coma. Samantha is all she has to be called a family. Jennifer immediately leaves for Lake Geneva. There she finds Sam in the bed unable to talk but Sam leaves her a number of letters telling her about the story of her life. Theses letters are all Jennifer has got as a form of interaction since her grandmother is not able to talk herself. As Jennifer reads the letter she discovers the secret of her grandmother's life. It also gives her an inspiration to not loose hope on love.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The story's outline seems to be very interesting. But the book has not been taken forward well. There are few elements which do not connect with the reader. There are also too many things happening in the book which is very distracting from the core message. The language is also very simple. There is no fun element in the style of writing. There were times when I just wanted to finish the book because I started it. I did not want to add book on in my half read self!!</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">In all I would say not the best philosophy book I have read. The message in the end is pretty nice which says love never dies. But again the plot is not good enough. You would not feel like waiting to reach to the message. Not worth reading!!</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">I would give this book 2 on 5. But would not give up hope on James Patterson as yet. Maybe I just picked up one of his not so great books!</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Do not waste your time on reading it. Dnd if you are reading it then do not expect much from it! Anyhow, do tell me your opinion! cya!</span></div>
