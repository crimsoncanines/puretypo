The first two books were amazing reads. The third book of the trilogy makes Amish tripathi highest earning&nbsp;Indian&nbsp;author till date.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The coverpage has been designed by the best team in the business. It definitely stands out and grabs your attention. The title itself is very intriguing since Vayuputras were not even in the scenario in the first two books.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The story begins when Shiva discovers that his friend Brahaspati is not dead. He is alive in panchvati and has been working on a secret experiment to save India from the evil. Shiva is happy to know that his friend is alive. Now he realizes his purpose in life. It is to figure out what is evil and eradicate it thus helping India. What is a surprise is that everybody knows what evil is but they do not fight against it. They instead wait for the Neelkanth to discover that it is evil and declare a war against people who are a part of this. During the course Shiva discovers his lineage. A horrific war is fought in order to stop "good from turning". Evil is conquered and destroyed. But it comes with loss which cannot be repaired by anyone. Shiva just waits for his death so that he is released from the mortal world.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book is not a literary wonder but is a terrific narration for sure. Amish tripathi has tried to align facts and figures with the shiv-puran or it is said so. The entire book is about battles and sorrows, so it might not be liked by many. The book all in all is a good read. All the anxiety before the book release has been successfully quenched by the author by giving the books a very justified beginning and a very realistic end. It also has a message for people which is remembered and again forgotten since time immemorial.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">I would go ahead and give the book 4 stars. go ahead and read it. no disappointments at all. Let me know what you guys think of it. Happy reading!</span></div></div>
