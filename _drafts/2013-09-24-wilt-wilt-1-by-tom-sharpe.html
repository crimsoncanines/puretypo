I had never heard of this author or the book before. So I decided to read on. When you see the book cover and the summary at the back you can always put it in the genre of PG Wodehouse. The book cover is cartoonish. The title is based on the lead character of the book.</span></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Tom sharpe is a very famous author who writes about class difference in a country. He is very famous for his satirical remarks in his book (which i got to know of when i started reading his book).&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book is about Mr. Wilt who is a professor of liberal studies at tech university. He is hates his job but is still tied to it since ten years. He is every time overlooked for promotion. And on top of that he gets to teach a bunch of butchers, carpenters, plasterers etc about literature which they are least interested in. Mr. Wilt's personal life is no better, he is married to Eva Wilt who is a man in woman's body (not literally). She is very dominating in the house. Mr. wilt is ever indifferent to her taunts and remarks.</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The problem occurs when he decides to act on his fantasies of murdering his wife and dumping her into the pit dug for pile foundation of a new block coming up in his university. He is gifted a life size doll by his wife when she leaves the house to teach him a lesson. Lesson that he can't live without his wife (when you read you will know why!!). Henry Wilt in his drunken state dresses up the doll in his wife's clothes and a wig and dumps it into the pit only to be discovered Monday morning by the worker who come to fill the pit with concrete. From there on he is taken into a police custody and being interrogated for the murder of his wife and two of his neighbors.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Wilt while being interrogated admits that he used to fantasize on murdering his wife which puts him more into trouble. And when the police finally discover Eva Wilt they quite understand, in fact, sympathize with Henry Wilt for wanting to murder his wife.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The author of the book is British and the book was first published in 1976. Therefore the book is filled with sentences which you might need to read over twice, or maybe thrice to understand. The book is a satire. It mocks the rich class in the society who call themselves intellectuals. The characters developed are very interesting. there are many witty and humorous instances in the book to have you laughing hysterically in public. The book definitely will keep you glued to it.</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book is by all means a must read. I will give it 4 stars. and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a break from all the recent releases. Go ahead and give it a shot!! cheers!</span></div>
