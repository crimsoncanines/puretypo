<h3>
1. Avonlea</h3>
Set in this very beautiful Island , this book takes one through the breathtaking landscape of Avonlea. While Anne is busy christening these wonderful places around her , the reader is quite anamored by the beauty of it all , and I assure you ,a little into the book and you will already want to travel to this wonderful place!<br />
<h3>
2. The people of Avonlea</h3>
From nosy neighbours, to the “kindred spirit” , Avonlea has all kinds of people that will keep you entertained throughout your journey with Anne . They are funny , simple and leave a mark on you just as Anne herself does.<br />
<h3>
3. The fantastic plot !</h3>
How often does one read a book about the life of an orphan who is accidentally sent to her adoptive parent ? While that is just the begining of Anne’s journey ,the writing has one glued to the book and it would not be surprising at all if you are recomending this book to everyone around you. Though the first time I read it I could not appreciate this , but the creativity of the Author deserves applause. I would try and fail to explain how wonderfully this book has been written , and one can only experience it first hand when one reads it ( did you buy it yet ?)<br />
<h3>
4. Anne with an ‘e’</h3>
Back in the day , I related to Anne as a contemporary, because I was around the same age as hers when I first read it. Now , Anne seems to be that little girl who is a leaf out of childhood that I can fondly look back to. She is the little niece that who I want to wrap in a squishy hug. She is the queer little girl I used to be , she is the queer little girl I still am in the grown up body.<br />
Her imagination has her standing out in the crowd just as her red hair and freckles do , but you may seem dull and unimaginative to little Anne. Not all are “kindred spirits” to her , but if she considers you one , pat yourself on the back for you sure have a spark in you.<br />
From an orphan who has had a rough few years , Anne shows us how there is so much to be grateful for , remind us to find joy in the little things around us , and to always look at the brighter side of things.<br />
<h3>
5. First of the many books in the series</h3>
While I am yet to read the many books in this series , it puts my heart at ease knowing that there is more of Anne that I can read in this wonderful series.<br />
So go grab your copy of this very adorable book , and dive into it NOW. As for me ,as much as I cherish my ancient copy of this book ,I could not help but buy this lovely Puffin edition.<br />
