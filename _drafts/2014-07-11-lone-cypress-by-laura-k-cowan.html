This book seemed to be very interesting when I read the brief. The main character is a ballet dancer who struggles because he metaphorical wings were clipped and she wanted to fly. Interesting. I wanted to read it and be amazed. But unfortunately nothing of this sort happened. Here is how I felt about the book. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Cover-page</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">: &nbsp;the cover page of the book is very lazily done. There is a ballet shoe and a lone cypress tree in the cover. The cover page is devoid of any artistic appeal. I am sure many of the reader will find it extremely boring and something not at all thought over. The book loses quite a few points in the beginning itself due to its cover page.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Characters:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;the lead character of the book is a lady called Shana who is escaping from her earlier life and striving to find something she had lost years ago. There is Jones who is the love interest of Shana. There is Lydia and Dinah who help Shana to get over her past and start afresh. The characters are interesting but lack depth in them. The lead character herself is not strong enough to leave her mark. The supporting characters are there but again very faintly visible. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Story line:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;the story is about Shana who escapes from her abusive husband and finds shelter in a beach town of California. She is struggling with the demons of past and the confusion of the life ahead. She is the damsel in distress and meets Jones who helps her get over her past and convinces her to spend her life in California fearless. The book is about Shanaâ€™s victory over her past and beginning of her new life with her passion for ballet. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Concept:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;the book is strongly influenced by ballet as a dance form and how it shapes lives. The concept in itself is very interesting. I have personally never come across a book which talks about a dancer and her love for dance and an emotional journey which she goes through. Very refreshing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Language:&nbsp;</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">the book is written in a very simple language. It is supposed to be a very emotional journey but unfortunately for me I did not find much of emotion here. There were also times when I wanted to leave the book midway and start reading something else. It was the sheer possibility of finding something interesting that kept me going. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Good points:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;I was very much intrigued by the concept of the book. Being a creative person myself I always love to listen to the creative journey of other people. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 13.5pt; margin: 0in 0in 8pt; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Bad points:</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;even with a very different concept and an interesting theme of the story the book fails to hold any attention. This books contains nothing that I would be unhappy to forget. Ballet is a very important part of this book but the author also has to understand it that not all of us are ballet enthusiasts let alone dancers. I wish the book was as promising as the concept itself. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-outline-level: 1;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;">Overall</span></b><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;">:&nbsp;the book is a forgetful one with its not so interesting plot and a very plain writing. The lazy cover just adds to all the bad points in the book. I would not recommend this one to anyone. And jumping to another amazing book before I get depressed! </span><b><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 24pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><o:p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></div></div>
