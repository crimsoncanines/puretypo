One book that I was looking forward to reading but was skeptical that it would be a typical MNB romance. But I was pleasantly surprised. The book is definitely a good end to the series if at all it ends here.</span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The title of the book "the marriage mistake" is not very innovative. You might have come across many books with similar titles. The cover-page is sensual unlike the last book where the cover-page carried mannequins. This one you would like to pick up on a rainy day just for its cover.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The main leads of the book are Maximus grey and Carina conte. The story begins when the book of love spell is passed on to Carina by her sister-in-law Maggie. Maggie asks Carina not to take the book very seriously. But Carina doesn't want to throw away any chance of her getting the man she always loved. Even if it meant performing a godforsaken love spell.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Carina is a shy girl who had a silly crush on her brother's best friend, Maximus. Maximus in turn thinks of Carina as a responsibility and refuses to think of her as a possible love interest. Maximus is not at all ready to let go of the things which are bound to go sour in case he starts dating Carina. This includes his friendship with Michael, Carina’s brother and their family’s trust to name a few.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Now that Carina has grown up into a beautiful sensual woman and has earned a business degree she has come back to work with her brother and Max. This time Carina decides that she will not go weak in the knees. It was Maximu's turn to do that. All both of them want right now is to have some fun and then get over each other. Wait. Did I say "not to be found out by anyone"??!!</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Their plan goes for a toss when Carina's mother finds out. And the next day they are married to each other!! In Vegas!!</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The book is a roller coaster ride of emotions. The denial and acceptance. The lead characters are very strong and convincing. The book definitely celebrated the joy of being together, confronting you deepest fears and bringing out the best in a person.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Jennifer has mentioned in a few places about "fifty shades of grey" which is interesting. It connected with the readers of this genre. Also a lot of writers would shy away from mentioning another book in the book they write. But Jennifer has gone ahead and done it.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The book is one of the bests by Jennifer Probst. I would give it four stars. Go ahead and read it. Let me know what you think ;)<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">CYA</span></span></div></div></div>
