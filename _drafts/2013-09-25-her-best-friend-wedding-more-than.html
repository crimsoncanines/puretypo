The story line seemed to be really catchy. Thought i would give it a try.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The story revolves around a girl called sadie who is exceptionally intelligent. She has been socially outcast because of her geek status ever since school. But she doesn't mind it except when she doesn't get a partner to dance with in the town. She finds her best friend in Meg. Her school time buddy. Meg is bang opposite in nature to sadie. She is a school time hottie and believed to have the power of having any guy to herself if she wanted. They grow up to share a house together. Sadie becomes a botanist. And Meg, no surprise grows up to be a flight attendant. Sadie loves Meg a lot and is always loyal to her. Until when Meg decides to marry the guy Sadie believes she is in love with. This is where the drama starts. The bride's brother comes into the picture and is determined to keep away Sadie from harming his sister's wedding.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The story is REALLY SLOW in the beginning. Not so powerful lead characters are combined with some really lame situations. When the story gets interesting the book is already over!! Meg is the character which keeps you alive throughout the book.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">overall the book is not the best of Abby gains. i would give it 2-2.5 stars.</span></div></div>
