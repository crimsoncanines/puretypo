It didn't appeal to me that time but i still coxed myself to give it a shot. Maybe i would like it.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The title of the book is beyond my understanding. I guess when you write so many funny books you kind of loose the interest in keeping a good title. See for example PG Woodehouse. Or even Tom Sharpe. Tom Sharpe is another author whom i discovered who writes hilarious book. Please go ahead and read him. you will not be disappointed. Anyways. getting back to "ten big ones". The cover-page of the book is also a happy go lucky kinds. Doesn't really seem like much thought has been poured into design.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The book is one among the series of stephenie plum novels. The book is about a bounty hunter called stephenie plum. She is a very brave and smart lady who always gets into some or the other problem. She tries to stay away from all the tricky situation but miserably fails this every time. this time stephenie is appointed a job to find few criminals and turn them in. The job seems to be simple because all she has to do is find a lady who robs a truck full of chips and eats the evidence away. Which in turn makes her fat and she is embarrassed to go to the court cause she doesn't have a roomy clothes to wear!! All stephenie has to do is to convince her that she is not looking fat and bring her to court for a hearing.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">These are the kinds of criminals that stephenie has to deal with. The&nbsp;trouble&nbsp;comes when stephnie's assistant&nbsp;accidentally&nbsp;blows away the bike of a slayer gang member when he is on the job of looting a deli mart. He thinks it is stephnie who has done it and she is on his hit list from then on. Stephnie worsens the situation by going into the slayer land for a "joy ride". Now the slayer have called a "junkman" from california to kill stephnie. Which is frightening right??</span></span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">But you won't feel so. Stephnie is a smart girl who's caught in tricky situations. They are hilarious and will get you laughing rolling on the floor!! There are many hilarious characters in the book. My personal favorites are gandma mazur and sally. They will get you hooked to the book.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">To call the book hilarious is an understatement. it would say its "unputdownable". Its a new word that has been discovered by people in goodreads!! the book is a definite must read. Please go ahead and read it. No disappointments what so ever. Let me know what you guys think!!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">4.5</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">cheers!!</span></div></div>
