It has a great mix of books from all the genres. It never fails to surprise you with the collection. “Fragments” is yet another book which I received from story cartel for review purpose. I am glad I came across the book. It makes me believe that it is not about the ending, but the journey itself that makes life so pleasant. Here is how I rate the book. </span><span style="color: #181818; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><br /><b>Cover-page:</b> the cover-page is not bad but could have been better. I see the humdrum of the city which is the entire book is about but it does not scream for attention. <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Characters:</b> the book is a collection of short stories taken from lives of different people at different places. Therefore there is not main lead or so called star of the book. Each character in each story is designed to fit the bill. They are not larger than life. One can very well connect with them.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #181818; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /><b>Concept: </b>concept of the book is very intriguing. The book is a compilation of short stories which occur in different cities. A simple and interesting concept. I like.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Story line:</b> storyline is simple. Nothing great. But it is all about how it is written. The first story is about a couple who are in Berlin. They are not interested in each other’s lives. And it ends with a bang. There is a story of a couple at an airport who has common interests but still is so detached. <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>My favorite would be the story of a man who is stuck in a scenario where he is required to help someone who has just met with an accident. Well written. Mirror for the society. <br /><br /><br /><b>Language:</b> the beauty of the book is the well written stories. As mentioned above these stories are taken from everyday lives in cities but the language really makes you think of the situations in depth.<br /><br /><b>Good points:</b> the book is a well written collection of short stories. It is well conceptualized and executed. <span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Not-so-good points:</b>I wish the punctuation was in place. I had a huge problem in differentiating dialogues to regular sentences. <br /><br /><b>Overall:</b> overall the book is a good read. I would recommend it to someone who is bored of the high drama content in fiction books. Someone who misses the old style of writing where English used to be a beautiful language, this is the book for you. Do read it and let me know that you think. </span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10.5pt;">&nbsp;</span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span class="apple-converted-space"><br /></span></span></span></span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><span class="apple-converted-space"><br /></span></span></span></span></span></div></div></div>
