I was high on my newly discovered ability to read full fledged novel. it was heavenly. I moved on to sidney sheldon and classics and never read john grisham after that before this book.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">Mark, an eleven years old boy, discovers a man trying to commit suicide in the middle on a nowhere land in memphis when he's out for a smoke with his kid brother. He tries to prevent him from committing suicide but only ends up getting a few bruises and watching him pull the trigger into his mouth. The man dies but leaves him a huge secret about a body which is buried somewhere. If found this body could lead to the murders who belong to mafia. mark's kid brother cannot take the shock and slips into comma. mark, now, is scared for his dear life. the mob is haunting him. The FBI is trying to get information out of him and his family is in great danger. Amid st all this he finds Reggie Love. his lawyer who would do anything to protect mark from the mob.</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The book was recommended to me by a friend and made it a point to read it. here's my take on the book.</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The beginning is very gripping. it moves very fast and keep you flipping pages. The excitement reaches a new level when Reggie Love enters the story. She tries every bit to protect mark from FBI till she realizes mob is the real enemy. The story gets boring somewhere in the middle. It feels like it is being dragged on without any reason. Towards the end it gets interesting when mark fools the employees at detention center into believing that he too is loosing himself like his little brother. The end is somewhat disappointing. well, i did not understand the why did mark come all the way down to new orleans to realize that he wanted witness protection. The story ended very abruptly which was a great disappointment. I was expecting a little more of thrill.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">In all, the book is well written. The language is more of a story teller than of a magnificent writer. The characters developed are very strong. Towards the end book gets a little boring.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">I would say this book was a great read just for the character in it. it maybe boring for some who read thrillers more often. It contains no such element which will excite them.</span></div>
