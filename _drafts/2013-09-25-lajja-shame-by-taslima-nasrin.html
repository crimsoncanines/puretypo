But she apparently liked it so much that she did not want to read the book ahead, scared that it will end on a bad note!! Instead she asked me to read it!!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">I picked up the book because i wanted to know what made her put it down!!&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">Taslima nasrin is a very famous author who was thrown out of the country because she had written about wrong doings Hindus had to face in Bangladesh after Babri masjid was destroyed in India. Destroyers never realized that their evil doings in India will infuriate Muslims all across the world and Hindus will have to face the consequences. The subject is really sensitive and has been handled well in the book.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The book narrates the story of a Bengali Hindu family in Bangladesh. They are free minded and do not believe in religion at all. when the masjid was destroyed in India riots broke out all over the subcontinent. In Pakistan and Bangladesh were not far away to escape the flames of the fire. Houses were being looted and plundered, women being raped, businesses being taken over forcefully to name a few crimes. Among st all this the dutta family was breaking away. Their ideologies were being shattered slowly and steadily. Sudhamoyee being the head of the family and patriot never wanted to leave. Kinmoyee did not want to upset her husband and hence agreed on what he said. Suranjan inherited the patriotism from his father and hence never thought of leaving either. But when Maya, his sister, gets abducted by seven Muslim guys who barged in their house in the middle of the night, their illusion fade away.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">The book is a very delicate account of the massacre that happened in Bangladesh. The book is heavy on emotions. Also loaded with statistical data. It directly aims at the political parties involved in the demolition of the mosque. i therefore respect her boldness.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">All in all the book is a fairly good read. Except the account of the crimes that took place. You would probably want to skip the detailed account of how many houses were set on fire and how many temples were destroyed.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;">I would rate the book three and five on five.</span></div></div>
