I managed to read the second part of the book first and decided never to read the first book again, yes, it was that bad!! After a long time I saw this book on amazon.com, and thanks to the new kindle, I immediately wanted to read a book on it. I bought this one. Huge mistake!! Here is what I think of the book.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Cover-page:</b> the cover-page of the book is sweet and nice. It may relate to the teenage kids even though I found it very kiddish. It could definitely be better. Needs some serious work.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Characters:</b> interestingly there are no lead characters in the book. The book is about a couple of school going kids and there messed up lives. There is Ananya. She is a shy and introvert girl who comes from a small town to Delhi. She joins this elite school which is a great cultural shock for her. She tries very hard to fit in but not lose her integrity.</span><br /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">There is Yuvraj who is madly in love with Natasha, the head girl of the school. And there is Naman, Yuvraj’s boyfriend.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The characters are easy to relate to but do not leave a lasting impact on the readers. The emotionless writing does no justice to the characters either.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Concept: </b>I kind of liked the concept even though it is outdated. The school romance, fights and everything you can relate with. Interesting to start with.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Story line:</b> storyline is nothing great. New girl in the school. Doesn’t know how to behave in the hip school. She meets a guy and starts liking him. But the guy is stuck with a bitch of a girlfriend. Etc etc. boring!!&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Language:</b> language is very simple. You would not need to pick up a dictionary to look for meaning. A simple read. The book in itself is very short. Can be easily finished in three hours.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Good points:</b> good concept. Easy to read.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Not-so-good points:</b> pathetic story. Emotionless writing. A material less read. No substance in the book at all.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Overall:</b> I made a mistake reading the second book. I made a mistake reading the first book again!! A complete time waste. Teenagers may enjoy it but I would definitely encourage them to read books with more substance in it. Would give it a 2 on 5.</span><br /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
