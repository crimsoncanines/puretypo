<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FqOnVm3VYgA/UkJKoapO0XI/AAAAAAAAAAY/u7Mc_1sEmfc/s1600/14347714.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FqOnVm3VYgA/UkJKoapO0XI/AAAAAAAAAAY/u7Mc_1sEmfc/s320/14347714.jpg" height="320" width="207" /></a></div><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">This book was recommended to me or rather forced on me by a friend who is planning to start her own company - WITH ME!! The books's title "How I Braved Anu Aunty &amp; Co-Founded A Million Dollar Company" is very catchy and not to forget lengthy! Cover design is also very interesting making it clear what the book is about.</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The author Varun agarwal is a engineering graduate who is sitting at home doing nothing even after one year of passing out from college. The other main character is his friend he calls Mal. and of course Anu aunty, who is the center of universe for his mother. Anu aunty is a typical&nbsp;Indian&nbsp;aunty who believes that a boys agenda in life should be to get an engineering degree, an MBA later and sold in the marriage market. Hence she becomes the&nbsp;villain&nbsp;of Varun's already not so perfect life.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">in the book Varun pre-warns you about him being an entrepreneur and not a writer. And pleads you not to be an enthu cutlet!!&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">contrary to what he says, Varun excellently portrays himself as a perfect example of a boy who has a unique idea and how every Anu aunty in the society is waiting to kill it in the brain itself. The book is filled with interesting incidences which every young entrepreneur can relate to. Banaglore's overcharging auto wallahs, the famous hangout places, the so called hep&nbsp;English&nbsp;used only in Bangalore add to the flavor. You will get a hint if you are a Bangalorean.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">And of course the storyline. the story is very interesting. there are many funny and senti moments in the story. Varun also offers the readers a a lot of tips and notes if they are interesting in starting on their own.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #cccccc; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">the book is not a literary wonder but definitely a good entertainer. the writing style is very simple. there are enough punches to keep you from sleeping. the story is&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;all the way.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><span style="color: #cccccc;"><br style="font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /></span><span style="background-color: clear; color: #cccccc; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">i would give it 4 stars. the book is definitely worth a read. let me know what you guys think of it. cheers.</span></div>
