This is the second book I am reading of hers. The first one was extremely delightful. And this one also is no less. It’s an answer for those who say that mills and boon romances are all plastic!!<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The story is about a woman who has lost her husband and has no other family. Jada Patel adopts a baby girl and after a year or so her real father comes to claim her. Jada is all shattered when the court decides the case in favor of the real father, Alik Vasin. Alik is a Casanova and Leena, his daughter, is a living proof of it. Alik realizes that Leena is not very fond of him and she needs her mother more.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Jada on the other hand refuses to be a nanny to the child. What she is looking for is an equal right on Leena as Alik. After much a thought they come up with an agreement of getting married and Jada being her mother, hence giving her equal rights as Alik.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Their marriage is not the real one. Here it means not from their hearts. They do it to protect their daughter's interests. Therefore physical intimacy is out of question. OR IS IT????</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">They naturally get intimate and fall in love with each other. And much after denials and running away they come in terms with the reality and find their happy ending.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The story is little different but the punch is the same. Forced marriage or marriage from not one's own will is a very cliché story line. But Maisey Yates does it in style. Her writing style is great. The book is full of emotional roller coasters. The essence of the book is brought out nicely.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Maisey Yates yet again entertains you to the fullest.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Will give this one 4 stars. Well deserved!!</span></span></div></div></div>
