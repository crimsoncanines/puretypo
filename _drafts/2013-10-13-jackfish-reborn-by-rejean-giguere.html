I picked it up basically because the storyline seemed different from other books that I have read. There are other books by the same author which caught my attention too. So I guess there is going to be more of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4715153.Rejean_Giguere"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; color: #666600; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 5pt;"><span itemprop="name">Rejean Giguere</span></span></a> on my book shelves.</div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;">Coming back to this book. Here is what I think.</span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Cover-page:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>cover-page is very interesting. It works well for catching somebody’s attention. The book cover says a lot about the story inside but still a lot is hidden. I kind of like the concept. </span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Characters:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>characters in the book are very different from each other. There is Dragon Chang who is a Chinese smuggler. He has come to the old town of Jackfish to discover the treasure that his grandfather discovered but could not bring it back. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;">There is Phil , who is a retired police officer. He now resides on the top of a hill in the town, running away from all the bad memories of the past. He is a handsome young man turned into wild. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;">And finally there is April Harrison. She is a traffic cop. Escaping a failed marriage and an abusive ex-husband she settles down in the town. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;">Until the first half of the book the story keeps moving back and forth from the present and past. The three characters in the present and Tiger, Dragon’s grandfather, in the past. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;">When you come across the characters you find yourself in awe. How can these characters be possibly connected? But here the suspense starts. Each of the character is designed to fit the bill. They are very unique and well sketched out. </span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Concept:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>the concept is very intriguing. The entire setting of the story is very different. </span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Story line:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>the story is about this town in Canada which is abandoned after a huge fire broke out at that place. In 80’s a man while laying down tracks in this town discovered a treasure which would allow generations after his to live in world’s best luxury. But as it happens, he is not able to take the treasure to his place. He instead writes a letter to his family explaining about the treasure. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;">Years later his grandson follows the trail and reaches Jackfish to discover the treasure. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;">The storyline is very gripping. It will keep you turning pages throughout the night. </span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Language:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>the language is very simple. The author is more of a storyteller than a writer. If you have loved Sidney Sheldon then you are going to love him too. Even though he has a long way to go before he even comes as near as Sheldon, his language is identical to Sheldon. </span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Good points:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>the book started very well. There was suspense at each point. All the characters are designed very well. The book keeps up the suspense revealing everything at the right time. The book is very gripping and definitely worth your time. </span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Not-so-good points:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>well, after all the suspense it generated I was expecting the book to end with a thunder. While it did happen, it also left another story unsaid. A curious person that I am, there are few answers that I am seeking for. What happens to the treasure finally? Does anyone discover it at all? Do Phil and April marry and get over their past lives? Hmmm… there needs to be a sequel!! &nbsp;</span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 9.0pt;"><br /><b>Overall:</b><span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>overall, the book is very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good thriller to spend his time with. I would give it 4 stars. Shall definitely get hold of other books by the author. </span><b><span style="color: black; font-size: 9.0pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div></div><div><br /></div><h2 style="text-align: left;"></h2></div>
