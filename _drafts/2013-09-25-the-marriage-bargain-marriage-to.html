For a change!! The cover looked very promising as an erotic book. So i decided to give it a try.</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The lead characters in the books are very strong. There is Alexandria, the female lead who believes in all the good things in life. She is a Santa's gift to all the sad souls on earth. She owns a bookstore and dreams of expanding the store someday when she has enough of money at hand.</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">And there is Nicholas, the male lead who carries a lot of negativity from his past. He is a always trying to stay away from commitments. He believes love, marriage and kids are not his thing.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The story starts when Alexandria's parents get into financial trouble and have decided to sell the house off to pay for other loans. Alexandria personifies scarlett O'hara and marries nick for $150,000. It is a bargain for nick because his uncle has left him an architecture office but he can own it only when he marries and stays married for a year.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">These childhood friends or enemies should i say, decide to be husband-and-wife for a year and part ways as friends. Except its what they want during the period, in sickness and in health and all other moments of life.</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The book is filled with a lot of erotic moments. The lead characters are very strong and interesting as i have mentioned earlier. The quick wit of Alexandria is a good match for the ever dominating nick. The story line is very tried and tested formula in mills and boon where the marriage is treated as a contract between two people to achieve their individual goals falling in love eventually as it happens. Even though the story line is a heard-it-and-bored-of-it-already, the book offers you great moments enjoy some of them would even make you roll on the floor laughing.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">It is definitely a relief to see that the leads are not&nbsp;portrayed&nbsp;as a god and goddess arrived on earth. They are pretty much real and can be someone you can come across.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">All in all the book is a good entertainer. Will definitely go on to read other books by the author. I would give it 3.5 stars . 4 would be a little too much considering the plot of the story. please go ahead and read it. :) And also let me know how you like it. :)</span></div>
