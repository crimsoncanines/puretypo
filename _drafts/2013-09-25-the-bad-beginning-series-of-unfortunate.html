And I happened to really like the movie!! So according to my experience I was hoping the book to be even better than the movie. Which was sadly not the case. The movie is starring jim carrey who is outstanding as the negative character. just wanted to mention it!!</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">Let me start with the cover page as i always do. The cover page is not very impressive but i think it works for kids because it has cartoons all over!! And the title the bad beginning only emphasizes on the first in the series of unfortunate events.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The book consists of many lead characters. Each of them as important as the other. The story is about three siblings namely violet, Klaus and Sunny. Violet is the inventor in the family. She has the knack of inventing new things and wants a huge workshop where she could practice her skills. Klaus loves reading and wants to one day read all the books in his parents library. And finally, Sunny is the youngest of them all. Her specialty is biting and talking in a language which no one understands. That is obviously because she is an infant!! So the story begins when Mr. Poe who is a friend of their parents brings them a sad news of their parents death. They therefore according to their parents will have to be sent to a relative's place to be taken care of. they thereby are sent to count Olaf who, no surprises, is a cruel man who only wants to grab the fortune that the children's parents have left for them.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">The story is indeed a series of unfortunate events which you would hate to read about. probably also quit reading in the middle. The narration is very impressive. there are sentences explaining the use of words and their dictionary meaning which might be appealing to the young readers. The characters are very impressive. the book is a complete entertainment!! Well i do not know whether that is an appropriate word to be used here!!&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">All in all the book is worth reading at least once. But since I have watched the movie already it spoils all the fun!! And also i kind of know what is going to happen in the coming books in the series.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px;">I would give the book 3.5 stars but that has nothing to do with the story. Go ahead and read it!! Cheers!!</span></div></div>
