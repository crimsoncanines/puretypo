And whatta book!! I had totally given up after the last book I read in the series. Almost wanted Count Olaf dead!! But you know what. It is not such a bad thing that he is alive and escaping every time. Although I do not wish that for the kids.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This book takes you ahead from the Paltryville mills where they were employed and fired. Now they are sent to a boarding school which they, no surprise, begin to hate. The boarding school has a pathetic name with a pathetic motto. They are sent there on the pretext of learning and also probably none of their relatives would want them after they have brought so many miseries to their previous guardians.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The kids land up in the boarding school only to discover that their lives are only going to change for the worse. The vice principle, Mr. Nero, is my favorite character in the book. He has a strange habit of repeating things in a mimicking fashion. He considers himself as the world's greatest violin player but in fact he's as pathetic as anyone can be. And the kids in the school are supposed to attend his violin concert failing which they will have to buy him three bags of candies and watch him eat too. There are many strange rules in the school which you will enjoy reading about and at the same time be disgusted with. There are more characters which keep the book alive. That includes their triplet friends, not friends and the teachers. They are all fun with their peculiar habits.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The book is an absolute entertainer. You will at no point get bored. The character is amazingly knitted into the story. The story itself is very interesting. There is a sense of curiosity throughout the book. The writing style of course is to die for. In all a must read. Would give it a well deserved 4.</span></span></div><div style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"><br /></span></span></div><h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;">BY SAME AUTHOR -&nbsp;</span></h4><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://acupofcoffeeandafairytale.blogspot.in/2013/10/the-wide-window-series-of-unfortunate.html" style="clear: left; float: left; line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sG8VRXwXBE8/UksbC_SUK5I/AAAAAAAAAIk/sSZJYxmYHFI/s1600/78418.jpg" height="200" style="line-height: 18px;" width="141" /></a><a href="http://acupofcoffeeandafairytale.blogspot.in/2013/09/the-bad-beginning-series-of-unfortunate.html" style="line-height: 18px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y9N014NbBIA/UksaVCMr-mI/AAAAAAAAAIc/si9xr17sPYs/s1600/78411.jpg" height="200" style="line-height: 18px;" width="132" /></a><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1NzVWFTVgsA/UksbmNGtuDI/AAAAAAAAAIs/KS-nhmIwsR0/s1600/438492.jpg" height="200" style="line-height: 18px;" width="140" /><span style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="line-height: 18px;"></span></div></div></div></div>
