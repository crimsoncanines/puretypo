This book is no different from the earlier ones. But just too boring of a plot. The kids are sent to another care taker who apparently has no name. Everybody calls him "SIR". Also he owns a lumber mill and illegally makes people work for him. He is way too filmy...!! Doesnâ€™t have a face. People just see the smoke from his cigar instead of his face. Ah...!! I would prefer Aunt Josephine coming back to life here. SIR is intolerable.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">So, he is the new care taker of these kids and he makes them work in his mill. Which is cruel I know. But what is crueler is that he feeds them gum for lunch!! And he employs Dr Ornwell who is the hypnotist. ooopppss... the ophthalmologist. He employs a receptionist and together they conspire to snatch away the family fortune of the kids. Ah!! I am tired already. There are few more characters. But its better you read about them!! Why should I be the only one subjected to the misery!!<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The author has tried role reversal here. Violet tries to read a heavy book and Klaus tries to invent. The book is really interesting in the beginning because the kids are in different setting altogether and there is a sense of curiosity. But it just gets boring from the middle of the book. There was a lot of scope for writing a good story but I m really disappointed. And SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP Mr. POE CATCH COUNT OLAF AND PLEASE LETS BE DONE WITH THIS MAN!!! I am so done with him escaping at the end of every book.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There were few good things about the book though. The writing style is as always very pleasing, for a young adult as well as the oldies. There is a bit of humor also at few places. But all these things could not be a substitute for a boring plot. I would give it 2.5 stars and I am not losing hope yet!! Will definitely carry on with the other books in the series.</span></span></div></div></div>
