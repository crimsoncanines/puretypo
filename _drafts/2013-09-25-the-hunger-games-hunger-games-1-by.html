The book is an example of literature which is an art and not just a read for leisure. Very well written and conceived.</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">I had heard a lot about the book and decided to give it a shot. I was introduced to young adult and fantasy genre sometime back and this book felt like a perfect new read.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The story is about a girl called Catniss who lives in district twelve of Panem. There are twelve districts in Panem in total and these districts have their own identity for example district twelve mines coal and district eleven cultivate crops. These districts are administered by the capitol. Capitol keeps an eye on all the districts and collects taxes from them. All these districts are left to fend for themselves after they pay the taxes and hence most of the districts are poor except a few like the one which supply jewels to the capitol.</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">There is an event which happens in Panem annually which is called hunger games. Two representatives from each district participate or rather chosen to fight for their lives in arena and only one emerges out as winner. And the others obviously die. It is a reality show, in short, of an entirely different level.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The story begins when Catniss's sister is chosen to be representing the district and Catniss volunteer's in her place. Now Catniss has to fight kill and win in order to come back and support her family or else she dies and her family suffers due to hunger.</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">Catniss hands over the responsibility of her sister to her best friend in the seam, Gale, and leaves for the games.</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The story is engrossing as ever. It gives shows another aspect of the reality shows and how it is much above the human emotions. This could definitely happen in the near future and maybe we would enjoy seeing people kill each other and make an entertainment show out of it. Of course with all the betting and sponsors it might not look all that bad.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The language is very simple. The content is out of the box. Desperately waiting to start the next book in the trilogy. Do read this one. It will open new doors in the world of imagination.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: clear; color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"><b><br /></b></span></div>
