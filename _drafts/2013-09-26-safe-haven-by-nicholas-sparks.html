He is one of the bests in the genre according to me. So when i got to know that a new movie is coming up based on his book i could not stop myself. I HAD TO read this book.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">I always do this. Read the book well before the movie comes out and act as a spoiler for my friends who are going to watch it. It's not very good habit though!! I end up knowing the story already. And if the movie is not as good as the book or they deviate from the story from the book I get disheartened. It is like someone has taken away the reason for you to live!! OK... So that's very dramatic!! But it definitely feels bad. Life of pi was an example. The movie was excellent but I never liked it as much as the book. Anyways. About this book.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">This is my sixth book by Nicholas sparks. I have been reading him since I was in my second year of college. And he has never disappointed me. Safe haven is another of his love stories but a lot different from something he has ever written before.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The book's title itself is very catching since it being a love story you would rather expect the title to be "heaven on earth" or "in love with you" or something like that. But safe haven is a different title which gives you a picture of some danger or a suspense in the book. The cover page is very catchy. Once you read the book you would know the significance of the bicycle with a basket and flowers in it. This book definitely has a better cover-page than a lot of other books of Nicholas sparks.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The story is about a woman who runs away from her husband's house to escape domestic violence. She comes to a town called Southport hoping that her husband will not come looking for her like earlier times. Katie gives up all the hopes of a happy life with a loving husband and children. Her priority now is to survive, stay hidden from her husband and hope that he never finds her. While staying in Southport she comes across Alex, a widower and a father of two. They fall in love as expected and wish to lead a life together. But katie finds it difficult to start a life because she knows that her husband is already looking for her everywhere. Right when katie is getting comfortable with her life her husbands find her and tries to kill her and the kids.&nbsp;</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">There is also a mysterious friend of hers who calls herself Jo. She has never been to Jo's cottage. She drinks wine with Jo but ends up drinking all of it herself. She&nbsp;accidentally&nbsp;bumps into her when she wants to have a chat with her friend. At one point in the ends she suspects herself to be talking to an alter ego of hers altogether. And if i tell you any further I would be spoiling all the fun.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">The book also looks differently at a victim of domestic violence and also victimizer. It portrays the the mental state of the victimizer too. Which is very interesting to know.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">In the end the chemistry that katie and alex share is also very heart touching. Alex is very easy to fall in love with when you are reading the book. The book portrays love from a different perspective.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">I think I am ready to watch the movie, even though it has been quite long since it was released. I just hope the movie is as good as the book.</span><br /><br style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="color: #181818; font-family: Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">Please Please Please read it and tell me what you think!! Laters!!</span></div></div>
