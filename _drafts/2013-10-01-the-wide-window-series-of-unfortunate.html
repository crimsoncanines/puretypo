And I think I am totally glued to the book. Each one is turning out to be better than the previous one.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: #181818; font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 115%;"><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In this book after the death of Uncle Monty the kids are sent to the house of Aunt Josephine. Who has all the possible phobias in the world? She is scared of the door knobs because she thinks it might break into small pieces and damage her eyes. She is scared of operating a phone because she thinks she might get electrocuted!! She is scared of operating an oven because she thinks it might burn down the house the house and she might die!!</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Aunt Josephine is the most interesting character I have come across in the series yet. She is a kind hearted woman who insists on the use of correct grammar. According to her grammar is the greatest joy of life. Making the kids miserable in turn. They are forced to eat cold food, read about grammar among few other horrible things!!<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">And agony increases when Count Olaf comes back in their lives this time in a disguise of a captain!! And like every time nobody believes the kids. They have to fight their own battle this time too. And they do it pretty well!! During a course they have to deal with Aunt Josephine who is a pain, decipher her suicide note and go and rescue her from curdled caves and prove that captain Sham is actually Count Olaf!!</span><br /><br /><span style="background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">And book is another in the series of unfortunate events. It is a thrill to read. A perfect read for a young adult. Itâ€™s a pleasure to have come across this book!</span></span></div></div></div>
