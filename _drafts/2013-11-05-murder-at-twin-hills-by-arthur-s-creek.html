Now, I picked up this book because I felt like reading some Sherlock Holmes kind of books. Well, in the beginning I felt good reading this book but it went on to become more entwined and boring towards the end. And now I cannot be happier that I finished the book!! Here is what I think of the book.&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #181818;"><br /><br /><b>Cover-page:</b>&nbsp;cover-page is pathetic. Pathetic photoshopping. With an interesting concept the cover-page has a lot of scope for creativity which is hardly seen here.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Characters:</b>&nbsp;I liked the book in the beginning because there were limited characters. The man, the wife, two daughters... then it went on to their butler, their cook, their neighbours, their dog.... oh... there was no dog... correct... no dog... but so many characters are enough to put you off. The detective seems like a strong character. I would have preferred to hear more of him.</span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #181818;"><br /><b>Concept:&nbsp;</b>concept of the book is been there done that. There is a murder at a house on the hill. The couple are newly married therefore the wife is accused of the murder. Nothing new.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Story line:</b>&nbsp;story starts from where the narrator introduces himself and his friend who is a detective and how they are stuck in a case which is very difficult to crack. And it goes on and on and on. Like it is a never ending tale.<br /><br /><b>Language:</b>&nbsp;the language is very simple. If one has been reading Sherlock Holmes he would know the terms such as alibi and dossier etc etc. They have definitely been over used in the book. And yeah. One more. MOTIVE!!<br /><br /><b>Good points:</b>&nbsp;the book started well. The writing is very simple and will not force you to go searching for a dictionary.</span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="line-height: 13.5pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #181818;"><br /><b>Not-so-good points:</b>&nbsp;well, where do I start? Bad cover-page, overused concept, loaded with insignificant characters. All these are enough to keep me away from the other books by the author.<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><b>Overall:</b>&nbsp;I would not recommend this book to the readers who are looking for detective mysteries like Sherlock Holmes. It will only disappoint you. In short, read it at your own risk!!</span><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><u1:p></u1:p>   <u1:p></u1:p>   <u1:p></u1:p>   </span><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div></div></div>
