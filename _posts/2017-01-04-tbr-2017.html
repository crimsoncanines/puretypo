While I surpassed my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51760228-gazala" target="_blank">Goodreads </a>challenge of reading 40 by 13 more books , this time around too I hope to read a lot many books and outdo my set target ! I read about 8 out of the 10 books that I aimed to read last year&nbsp; along with all the other books that I picked on whim. This time around my TBR is going to be a mix of Authors, genres and titles that I would like to read throughout the year. <br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1n4bFi43hWY/WGwb0b9MHtI/AAAAAAAACE0/Li9f5iFUVgM/s1600-h/5ba3b07b-a37b-4f94-907e-57736a81d7ed%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="5ba3b07b-a37b-4f94-907e-57736a81d7ed" border="0" height="167" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-c_UhapwyjIo/WGwb1Chyh8I/AAAAAAAACE4/5PB5gyaN9xU/5ba3b07b-a37b-4f94-907e-57736a81d7ed_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="5ba3b07b-a37b-4f94-907e-57736a81d7ed" width="244" /></a><br /><br /><h3>1. Explore more Magical Realism</h3>While I fell in love with both magical realism and Murakami , I could read only one book by him. I also collected&nbsp; a few Gabriel Garcia books, and wish to read both these&nbsp; masters in the forthcoming days. <br /><h3>2. Children’s books</h3>Yes, another genre I loved in 2016! I procured the entire Anne set and would love to re-read Anne of Green Gables and all other titles in the series. Other than this I would only be too happy to squeeze in an Enid Blyton and some other loved writers for children. <br /><h3>3. Short Stories</h3>Reading short stories is an ideal way to take a break from lengthy exhaustive reading . They make for great reads while travelling , and maybe planning to read these will bring some luck with travelling too . <br /><h3>4. The original and the re-telling</h3>This is one thing that I really look forward to ! Reading an original and it’s retold version sounds fun right?<br /><h3>5. Classics</h3>The genre I like the least - the language is strenuous and the plot can be tiresome , but they are what they are for in-spite of being difficult reads ,&nbsp; they leave you awestruck and with a lot to think about! Maybe a classic or two throughout the year wouldn't be too bad, would they ? <br /><h3>6. Author goals</h3>I really wish to read some Authors like Milan Kundera, Amitav Ghosh , more Bukowski etc , why ? They are extensively loved by so many bibliophiles and it’s a shame I haven't read a lot by them!<br /><h3>7. Agatha Christie </h3>I have a growing stack of books by this legend .What’s the use of them if I ain't reading a couple of them throughout the year ?<br /><h3>8. Throwing in some love</h3>I need to read me some romance,&nbsp; as it seems I am losing the romantic in me!<br /><h3>9. Spiritual/ non-fiction books</h3>I am not too fond of non fiction , but the only way to truly understand the real world is to delve deeper in it. I hope to read at least one book that makes me a tad more spiritual , or probably makes me more aware of real people , and real situations. <br /><h3>10. Them mysteries</h3>Yes, the genre I LOVE! Needless to say I hope to read mysteries of all kinds . Be it a psychological thriller , or a crime thriller – I am sure going to read a lot of these!<br /><h3>11.&nbsp; Fantasy </h3>A genre that I haven't read , because&nbsp; I have a preconceived notion that I possibly wouldn't enjoy it.Hoping to read at least one fantasy , just to step into a magical world , because <em>sometimes,all you need is a little magic</em>. <br /><h3>12. Commit to a Series </h3>The commitment phobic person that I am , I failed starting “A song of Ice and Fire” in 2016 , but I continue to resolve to read a series even if its not all the books in a year , at least one can hope to make a start. <br /><h3>13.Poetry </h3>Another genre I love , I hope I read more poetry than I did last year- for in these intense , sensuous lines a part of me finds home<br /><h3>14.More Readalongs!</h3>Reading along with a bunch of book-lovers is fun! The discussions that follow , the dissection of the book , the various perspectives , and the understanding of characters from so many different angles is enriching and I wish to soak more of the awesomeness spread by fellow bibliophiles.<br /><h3>15.NO READATHONS</h3>The one thing I despise the most is reading in a rush ! Reading is therapy , reading is done best when done at one’s own pace .Reading is wholesome when you can savor the lines , dwell on the emotions and re-read until to read between the lines , and reading with the clock ticking in my ears is an absolute no-go!
