<div><div>My recent interest in different forms of poetry and feminist literature has brought me to 'The Princess Saves Herself In This One'. This book of poems has been appreciated by many poetry lovers and book bloggers alike. Therefore I decided to give this one a shot. Also, the title drew me in at first sight. Who doesn't want to be her own knight in shining armor. This book turned out to be everything I had hoped for.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8zE8jhyboR0/V_XlqE8x9MI/AAAAAAAAEFo/Wmcfh0zUC7YuieAZ5x1WYKjFQ5Mvp2hJQCLcB/s1600/IMG_4815.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="472" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8zE8jhyboR0/V_XlqE8x9MI/AAAAAAAAEFo/Wmcfh0zUC7YuieAZ5x1WYKjFQ5Mvp2hJQCLcB/s640/IMG_4815.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3>Cover page&nbsp;</h3><div>The cover page is a glimpse of the poetry inside. It is plain and simple. The title is off-centered on the page, like some of the poems inside. There seems to be a no-nonsense approach in the poetry inside and that is seen in the typography too. The same is reflected in the cover page.&nbsp;</div><div>The straight to the point approach of the cover is much appreciated. It is a brilliant cover design.</div><h3>Content&nbsp;</h3><div>The book is divided into four parts. The first section is called 'the princess'. Here the poems are more juvenile. The content inside focuses on the ripe age of a girl where she is mostly dependent on others. The poet writes about fat shaming, parental negligence, her indulgence in books due to lack of friends and first love which hurt. The poet here is trying to be the daughter that her parents had in mind. She is waiting for the knight in shining armor without realising that she could rescue herself. The first section of the poems is filled with innocence.&nbsp;</div><div>The second part of the book is about 'the damsel' who is rescued from a&nbsp;tower without realising she was only trading one tower for another. There is again, some love and a lot of hurt. At this point, she is already fearing big bad wolves. She is also coping with the&nbsp;death of a loved one.&nbsp;</div><div>The third section is that of 'the queen'. Here she is the sole ruler of her kingdom. She has realised that she can be her own happy ending. The poems are strong and direct. There is a glimpse of rejoice seen in the lines. She has also learned to believe in love and give it a chance.&nbsp;</div><div>The fourth and final part is of 'you'. The poet here is directly talking to the readers. She is encouraging and accusing.&nbsp;</div><div>The poems are very direct and hard hitting. The poet asks people to treat others better if they do not want to end up in other's poems. She is brash and unapologetic. The text inside takes the shape of the feelings inside. Sometimes the letters form a heart and sometimes they are just scattered like stars in the sky. The words are far apart, like the poet is counting words. Like she wants every word to mean something, hit hard like a stone in the ear.&nbsp;</div><h3>Language&nbsp;</h3><div>Poems are very simple to understand. These are just a few words put out on paper, arranged in a way to convey the direct message. The poet often talks in terms of 'I' and 'You', directly addressing the readers. There is no escaping from the truth and the pain that you have caused her. The poems seem to reach you till your bone, there is no hiding from what you have done.</div><h3>Good points&nbsp;</h3><div>The cover page is beautiful. Not to look at but to feel it. Once the content inside is read the cover feels like a poem on its own. The poems are stunning. They are outrageous, accusing, but stunning all the same. The aches of being a woman and other personal tragedies have been let out in the book, stripped bare. The language is simple and hauntingly direct.&nbsp;</div><h3>Bad points&nbsp;</h3><div>At times the book feels too full of accusations. It may come across as the author is writing it to put all those who put her through bad times on a scaffold.&nbsp;</div><h3>Overall&nbsp;</h3><div>Even though at times I felt like the book was treated as a channel to let out the angst, I still enjoyed most of the poems inside. They are to the point and scream for attention.&nbsp;</div><h3>Who do I recommend this to&nbsp;</h3><div>This book is for all those who are new to poetry and different forms of it. Those who enjoy feminist literature are going to love this one too.&nbsp;</div><h3>Quotable quotes&nbsp;</h3><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">You have<br />Been the<br />Star<br />Of each<br />&amp; every<br />One of<br />My<br />Nightmares<br />-You left but you stayed&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">I'm not scared<br />Of the monsters<br />Hidden underneath<br />My bed<br />I'm much more scared<br />Of the boys<br />With messy brown hair,<br />Sleepy eyes,<br />&amp; mouths<br />That only know<br />How to form<br />Half-truths<br />-my dragons</blockquote></div>
