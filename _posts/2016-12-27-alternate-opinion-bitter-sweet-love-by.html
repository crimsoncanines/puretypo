<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Bitter Sweet Love, as the title suggests different flavors of love as we come across it. The book is a collection of poetry and short stories prodding the many dimensions of love. Some poems are deep and some are very simple. But what I liked the most in the book is short prose. They display a physical and mental escapism which is alluring. 'The Boardwalk' being my favorite, explores time travel. Other stories display his love affair with multiple women over the period of time. Lucy is the star of the book, though. The stories featuring her are more attention grabbing than most.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PTdJCpk5HPU/WEFIs5qYMGI/AAAAAAAAEJU/mfan_1StQ1o-uuYJHfl0vweUM0vvhkqKwCLcB/s1600/IMG_5073.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PTdJCpk5HPU/WEFIs5qYMGI/AAAAAAAAEJU/mfan_1StQ1o-uuYJHfl0vweUM0vvhkqKwCLcB/s640/IMG_5073.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The poems and one-liners are beautiful too, but they somehow fail to hold attention. Frequent use of 'electricity' to describe any tingling feeling is annoying.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The author hates goodbyes. Therefore he invites the readers down the rabbit hole. It is a sweet parting message.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, I liked the collection. Loved some of the writings but just liked the book as a collection.</div></div>
