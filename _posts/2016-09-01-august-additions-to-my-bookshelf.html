<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">As fellow Meraki post members say, I go a little crazy when it comes to buying books, but as I always correct them – it is crazy and broke! But buying books is so wonderful, I’d happily be broke. Thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebibliobox/" target="_blank">The Biblio Box</a>, I now try to buy books around the theme so that my book buying is a little more organised and not too random. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-72MTNf1w_f0/V8g8FeCmbPI/AAAAAAAAByc/eo3QsGw4KK8/s1600-h/14215693_10210829730324518_792070352_o%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img alt="14215693_10210829730324518_792070352_o" border="0" height="181" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4CEt0h3UyHw/V8g8F577X4I/AAAAAAAAByg/H4FSoj_v-YY/14215693_10210829730324518_792070352_o_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="14215693_10210829730324518_792070352_o" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">At the start of the month, I stumbled upon some beautiful hard bound classics from Crossword bookstore , made for them by Penguin Publishers. I own a tattered copy of <i>Black Beauty</i>, and was looking for a nicer one as I love the book, and I just seem to have found one. Hence I bought this one and bought <i>The secret Garden</i>, because I have heard wonderful things about the book, and had to have it on my shelf!</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Coming to my upgraded box! The theme for August was Crime fiction, and I chose to upgrade it with a bunch of used books by varied authors. The box itself had <i>The Trap by Melanie Raabe</i>, and <i>The Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie</i>. Apart from which they had a hoard of crime themed bookmarks, a hand cuff bracelet, a key-chain with a quote from Sherlock and a BIBLIO scarf, which is again inspired by Sherlock Holmes! I got <i>Three act tragedy, Mrs.Mcginty's dead, Problem at Pollensa Bay, Murder is easy- all by Agatha Christie</i>, and <i>Prophecy by Peter James</i>. I picked&nbsp; <i>Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde</i> from a local bookstore as it was another book that was listed by them and I wanted for myself. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Apart from these, I got some lovely books by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/panmacmillanindia/" target="_blank">Pan Macmillan India</a>.&nbsp; I got <i>The Muse, The thing about Jellyfish </i>and<i> What lies between us</i> from them. I just love how wonderful these books sound, and I have been very very excited about <i>The Muse</i> and look forward to reading it soon. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, I love how diverse my bookish purchases have been this month, and to make myself feel it wasn't a very expensive affair, as most books are used (but in very good condition), and the hardbacks came at a great price, and I got some to review. The only flip-side is – I DO NOT HAVE SHELF SPACE!</div></div>
