<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Twinkle Khanna came into the spotlight last year when Mrs. Funnybones released her first book of non-fiction. Just a couple of incidents coated with funny remarks and hilarious derivations the book was good enough to make you smile. After reading the book I made a mental note of reading more from her. Not a great fan of the columns, it was a relief when her next book of fictional stories was announced. Fiction I always believed would be her greatest strength if she went on to write one. And God, I was so right!&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lPQQgU-XrzQ/WD6eS8ryknI/AAAAAAAAEIw/MyFkRg6cZ78bfe5d-StMrjHTEe6GSMzPwCLcB/s1600/IMG_6373.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lPQQgU-XrzQ/WD6eS8ryknI/AAAAAAAAEIw/MyFkRg6cZ78bfe5d-StMrjHTEe6GSMzPwCLcB/s640/IMG_6373.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name='more'></a>Cover page&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">There is a language being followed in the books by the author. This one too, as her previous one, contains an illustration which is relevant to the story inside. The cover page is beautiful, unlike the metamorphosed face of her on the last book cover; this one is sweet and simple.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Characters&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The book features multiple interesting characters. They are as common as our neighbor next door and as rare as the age old grandfather who witnessed the struggle for independence.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Lakshmi Prasad is a girl who discovers a simple way to change the life of women by a small deed. Nino Appa has safeguarded her reputation for all these years but she is now ready to live her life as she chooses. Another woman is preparing for her fifth wedding but she has already given up on love. She does not believe that a man, deaf or dumb, is a man. And of course, the star of the book is Bablu. The only man who found a place in this feminist literature by a feminist author. Bablu has set out to do something to change the lives of countless women by allowing them to earn their own living.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">All these characters have just one thing in common. They are all defying 'rules'. They are doing their own bits in bringing small changes to the place they live in.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Content&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The book is a collection of four short stories, of four distinct characters, who in their own small ways have tried bringing change into the society. Here Lakshmi Prasad is giving women something of their own to own. In her village, now, the birth of a baby girl is celebrated by planting trees. Nino appa has finally realised that she has only a few more living moments left&nbsp;and she wants to spend it with a man whom she loves and not live by the rules of the society. The story celebrates young love at old age.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">A woman is compromised into several marriages and finally realised that she is not meant for one. She does not believe the man to be the supreme lord and decides to walk out of marriages for a better life.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The last story is of a man who begins making sanitary pads, for his wife to use instead of an old rag of a cloth piece. Slowly this interest grows into obsession till he makes a machine which can manufacture sanitary pads at a quarter of the cost. This is a story derived from a true one. That makes it all the more special.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">All these are simple stories of revolutionary ideas. It is an innovative collection. Definitely stories worth telling. Several brand references such as Parachute oil and The Times of India bring readers closer to the book as they connect with them better.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">These stories may feel lengthy at times, several times getting off the track but they are worth listening to.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Language&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The writing is simple. The narration is brilliant. The stories are loaded with emotions. They contain the Twinkle Khanna trademarked hilarious potions too. Every bit of the language speaks about the author.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Good points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover page is simple and visually pleasing. The characters are far from ordinary. The stories are innovative. The narration grabs your attention straight off.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bad points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The stories went off track several times. The change in the format was evident. The last story felt a little too stretched.&nbsp;</div><div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Overall&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">I am glad I read this book. It has piqued my interest in the genre.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Whom do I recommend this to&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">This is for voracious readers and those new to the hobby. Those who enjoy short fiction with some wits are going to enjoy this too.</div></div></div>
