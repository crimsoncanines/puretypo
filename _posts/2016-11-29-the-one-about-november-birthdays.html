Born on&nbsp; 10 November 1960, he is loved for his unique story telling skills and illustrated books. </div><blockquote><div>Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div>I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes...you're Doing Something.</div></blockquote><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Louisa May Alcott</h3><div>Born November 29, 1832 , she was an American novelist and poet best known as the author of the novel <em>Little Women</em> and its sequels <em>Little Men</em>&nbsp; and <em>Jo's Boys</em>. Little Women is set in the Alcott family home, Hillside, later called the Wayside, in Concord, Massachusetts and is loosely based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her three sisters. The novel was very well received and is still a popular children's novel today, filmed several times making her one of the most adored writer of all times. </div><blockquote><div>She is too fond of books, and it has turned her brain.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div>Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow…</div></blockquote><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Mark Twain</h3><div>Samuel Langhorne Clemens&nbsp; born on November 30th, is&nbsp; better known by his pen name Mark Twain. He is a very loved&nbsp; American writer, entrepreneur, publisher and lecturer. Among his novels are The <i>Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>&nbsp; and its sequel, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, which is loved by bibliophiles of all ages. Twain began his career writing light, humorous verse, but evolved into a chronicler of the vanities, hypocrisies and murderous acts of mankind and left us with beautiful words, that are witty and thought provoking just the same. </div><blockquote><div>Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div>Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.</div></blockquote></div>
