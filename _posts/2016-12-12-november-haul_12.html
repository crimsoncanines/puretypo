Space crunch is a real problem for bibliophiles , but it isn't reason enough to not buy more books! So here I am , with my November book haul , though&nbsp; I have absolutely no room for more books! <br /><br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--5k9WBwnpm4/WE6RjhbNmTI/AAAAAAAACDg/gwhU4J_6jjk/s1600-h/nov%252520haul%2525204%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img alt="nov haul 4" border="0" height="229" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UlVuDpOxV0s/WE6RkAZT9NI/AAAAAAAACDk/xkrNDARu-j4/nov%252520haul%2525204_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="nov haul 4" width="244" /></a><br />My first ever Comic Con visit was everything and more that I thought it would be , and I found these amazing <em>Sufi Comics</em> there!! The author was not just gracious enough to sign it but also doodle for us. This is the most unique way of getting my sufi fix , and I&nbsp; cant wait to dive into these (yes I got all four of them!) . My favorite bookstore opened it’s second outlet and thanks to the new store visit , I found some very stunning used books – out of which these<i> Snoopy</i> comics are a sheer treasure ! <br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-21GDoi6sQ8o/WE6RkjMEB-I/AAAAAAAACDo/Rm9X8h8tK5U/s1600-h/nov%252520haul%2525203%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img alt="nov haul 3" border="0" height="244" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rWBGyjSL8PI/WE6RlJzGPMI/AAAAAAAACDs/GWADi9BEs2I/nov%252520haul%2525203_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="nov haul 3" width="196" /></a><br /><br />Though am vary of buying used books online , I tried it out thanks to the wonderful recommendations by&nbsp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1009350245745680/" target="_blank">“Book Deals for Broke Bibliophiles – India” </a>and I was not disappointed! The books were in &nbsp;an excellent condition and &nbsp;came well packed . Overall , though I really feel used books are best purchased at the store , you could totally check them out online too ( I used a seller called AMAZE&nbsp; on amazon- and though I was very happy with their service , I cannot vouch for the same all the time as it was my first and only experience so far) .<br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-d1q3qhuOdpU/WE6Rlk1huHI/AAAAAAAACDw/9yl-xEByXlI/s1600-h/nov%252520haul%2525202%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img alt="nov haul 2" border="0" height="181" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QQhUFQC8di0/WE6RmLvmIVI/AAAAAAAACD0/JHWQWQ9n5Mc/nov%252520haul%2525202_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="nov haul 2" width="244" /></a><br /><br />Coming to more used books , I found some very gorgeous vintage editions that I had no need for , but again – how does one even resist books as fine as these? These covers /editions are no longer in the making , making them all the more precious , and a treasured part of my growing library. <br /><br /><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WsGLXJztE14/WE6RmsYBjeI/AAAAAAAACD4/EMuxSyVSzCk/s1600-h/nov%252520haul%2525201%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img alt="nov haul 1" border="0" height="244" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-muys-Ri_lW8/WE6RnIZCg_I/AAAAAAAACD8/7tAFBEobdn8/nov%252520haul%2525201_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="nov haul 1" width="239" /></a><br />Lastly , thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebibliobox/" target="_blank">the biblio box</a> , I got my hands on some brand new books – part of which were a part of the box , and some more I got to be reviewed. Oh, not to forget , I got two copies of <i>The Great Gatsby</i> – one sent to me in a book exchange – and the other , I purchased simply because I loved the cover! How could I even forget mentioning the fact that I was very fortunate to &nbsp;see the very fantastic Jeffrey Archer &nbsp;, and procuring a signed copy that he is touring currently for!<br />Do let me know if you would like a copy of the&nbsp;<i>The Great Gatsby</i>&nbsp; , as I have one to spare !<br /><br />Happy December!
