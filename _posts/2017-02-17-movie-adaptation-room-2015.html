<div><div>It was during the times of oscar when I heard about the book. Inspired by true events it was bone chilling to even think that a crime like this could take place somewhere in the world. Woman being kept captive and birthing child in just a room. After a lot of delay I finally purchased a kindle copy of the book.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_T-VWcBfhmo/WE6qzr2Fc8I/AAAAAAAAEJo/symxy93UT4Q4RKcYJQWkr6Tkr6RTd3mfQCLcB/s1600/IMG_1868.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_T-VWcBfhmo/WE6qzr2Fc8I/AAAAAAAAEJo/symxy93UT4Q4RKcYJQWkr6Tkr6RTd3mfQCLcB/s640/IMG_1868.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3>The Book&nbsp;</h3><div>A child of five is the narrator in the book. He is used to a room. He does not realise the existence of the world outside. The slow introduction to the world begins when his mother shows him a fallen leaf from the tree and an air plane in the sky. The slowly progresses when both the mother and son manage to escape the captivity. What follows is the visits to the clinic and grandmother's. The story loses interest and pace after the great escape. I started disliking the book halfway through.&nbsp;</div><div>The childish narration did not reveal much about what happened while in the captivity. I was completely disappointed by the book. It did not live up to my expectations at all.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TmV-lPsCL6Q/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TmV-lPsCL6Q?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div><div><br /></div><h3>The Movie&nbsp;</h3><div>The movie is a package of good acting and great direction. The movie is an adaptation. Most of the parts are same as the book but few things are changed which only make the movie better.</div><div>While the book is from a claustrophobic perspective of the child, the movie covers all the dimensions. The family support and what goes on inside the mind of the victim is well describes. This is the version I like best of the story since I missed it completely in the book.&nbsp;</div><div>The actors are just brilliant. Especially the child. The transformation is incredible.&nbsp;</div><h3>Overall&nbsp;</h3><div>This is one of the few occasions where I enjoyed the book more than I enjoyed the book. Regrettably so, since i waited to read the book before I watched the movie.</div></div>
