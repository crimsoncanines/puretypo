<div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><div>Ryan has been very kind to send me her&nbsp;book, this time&nbsp;around too. And I am on cloud nine. This time, I also have a set of questions which she has answered about her writing. You can find it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2015/10/author-interview-ii-ryan-ringlboom-on.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have already said enough about it already and it is no secret that I love it. So here is the review describing different aspects of the book.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wKj1EwH-KFY/Vg99evr92iI/AAAAAAAADR4/H_vMdgw_FCE/s1600/IMG_20151002_145338.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wKj1EwH-KFY/Vg99evr92iI/AAAAAAAADR4/H_vMdgw_FCE/s640/IMG_20151002_145338.jpg" style="cursor: move;" width="640" /></span></a></div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">I didn't have much to add except for some flirty comments that made me look like I didn't have a brain in my head. Of course I did, but you could never let a man know that.</blockquote><h3>Cover page</h3><div>This has been the trend in the books by the author. The cover pages are always very bland. But I must say I liked this cover better than all her other books. It says what it has to without revealing much. But I would still want to see a beautifully designed cover for her book.&nbsp;</div><h3>Characters</h3><div>Zackery is a billionaire who wants to do much more than just making money. He has a special talent of turning food into work of art. He is tired of been looked through a glasses of richness. He wants to go past the money-making game and do something for the underprivileged. Also, he wants to find someone who will love him for what he is, and not because of all the wealth he has inherited.&nbsp;</div><div>Kenna is a woman who had lived on the gifts showered by rich and in turn given them what they want. She is a hooker, to be blunt. Kenna is coming back from her best friend's wedding, penniless.&nbsp;</div><div>Zackery longs for true love and Kenna for true money. Sounds like a match made in heaven!&nbsp;</div><h3>Content</h3><div>The book begins when Kenna is returning from her best friend's wedding. She has no money and no place to stay considering she does not want to go back to her mother's place. She makes some quick buck on the way in a hotel and drives on. Somewhere on the way she gets a call from Tariq and it looks like she has an assignment.&nbsp;</div><div>Kenna is invited by Zackery's father to keep Zack occupied till their hotel is complete. But it seems like a tough job. Zack will not settle for anything less that true love.&nbsp;</div><div>The content is engrossing from the beginning. Kenna's story is gripping. She will keep you on her toes throughout. Ryan's style is very evident in this book too.&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">Two women who were extremely alike in all the wrong ways were a bad combination.</blockquote><h3>Language</h3><div>The narration is extremely gripping. The story flows through very smoothly. The story is narrated in first person. So you feel closer to the characters. The alternate narration helps to understand both the characters' point of view. I just love how Ryan glides through the pages. Amazing!</div><h3>Good points</h3><div>The characters are just beautiful. Zackery is very calculative and Kenna just keeps you going. Both of them keep you engaged throughout the book.&nbsp;</div><div>The content is amazing. The story is told well. Narration is like magic. Truly wonderful!&nbsp;</div><h3>Bad points</h3><div>The cover page is again something which does not work. I wish I had got a better cover from the author.&nbsp;</div><h3>Overall</h3><div>Overall the book is another wonder from the author. Ryan is just getting better and better with each of her books.&nbsp;</div><h3>Who do I recommend this to</h3><div>This book is for someone who likes off-beat romance and believes in all good things in life. Someone who likes a bit of grays among all whites, this is the book!</div></div></div>
