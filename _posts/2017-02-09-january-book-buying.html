<div><div>With the new year come aspirations to hoard more books, but I have made a conscious decision to reduce buying books I don't really want. Hence, I have decided to stick to my list of books and try to buy only those (even as I am writing this, all I can think of is about the titles that Iâ€™ve never heard but will be on my shelves soon, from my visit to the bookstore!)</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yoqxdOLl9oo/WJtiD8aPbYI/AAAAAAAACHo/gFiFrnG8K_c/s1600-h/IMG_20170131_191746_704%25255B2%25255D.jpg"><img alt="IMG_20170131_191746_704" border="0" height="244" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-eYOmYoZsYNo/WJtiEd8h3NI/AAAAAAAACHs/p-OwLCgKfZM/IMG_20170131_191746_704_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="IMG_20170131_191746_704" width="219" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>But January was a good month where I did stick to my wish list. I picked <em>Jihadi Jane, Lifting the veil</em> and Milk and honey from my wishlist! I really look forward to reading at least one of these really soon.</div><div><br /></div><div>Apart from this, I got a religious book that elaborates on the <em>99 names of Allah</em>. I received <i>The twentieth&nbsp;</i><i>wife</i>&nbsp;and <em>Heartless</em> in my Jan box from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thebibliobox/">The Biblio Box</a>. I really enjoy fiction set amidst the royalties, and the ones set in India especially!</div><div><br /></div><div>I happened to receive a review copy of <em>Here be dragons</em> from the author himself&nbsp;and a very dear friend who I met via the wonderful world of books gifted me <em>Why I write</em>.</div><div><br /></div><div>With a mix of review copies, gifts and books that I actually wanted to buy, my book hoarding has started on a good note! Hope you have some fun book buying plans for 2017 as well!</div></div>
