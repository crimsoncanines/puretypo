<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">I have not read many picture books as such but my recent stumbling upon an illustrated fairy tale has piqued my interest in picture books. These books are not only read for their story but also for the pictures/illustrations they contain inside. I decided to review the book just for its beautiful cover but what it contains inside is even more promising.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was his first day at school and he fell in love. 'The day I became a bird' had me since the beginning.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nj-NHd4QHAM/V7qsTzb3wMI/AAAAAAAAD6c/emlmjkJ7CSMPKjwlB_cVNemI1BlDEN0JQCLcB/s1600/IMG_2933.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nj-NHd4QHAM/V7qsTzb3wMI/AAAAAAAAD6c/emlmjkJ7CSMPKjwlB_cVNemI1BlDEN0JQCLcB/s640/IMG_2933.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><h3>Cover page</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover page consists of a sketch of a bird with large eyes and slender feet. The title 'the day I became a bird' holds a place on top right corner of the book making the bird on the cover the focus. The back cover too has a tiny bird sitting on the football which is meaningful to the story. The book itself is a well thought out product. The story begins with the boy wanting to turn into a bird and ends with the two characters uniting. The illustrations are suggestive and not smothering. The colors are kept visually subtle. The typography compliments the illustrations.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">One of he best covers I have come across this year.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Characters&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">It is a story of a boy who falls in love with a girl on the first day of his school. He is very simple and creative. The innocence in the character makes him even more appealing. His thoughts, as put across by the author, are lyrical. He also possesses the goodness of appreciating a person for her kindness which is a sweet trait.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Coming to her lovely lady, Sylvia is a girl obsessed with birds.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>'There are birds on her pants and dresses.</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>She wears bird barrettes in her hair.&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>She draws birds in her notebooks and folders.&nbsp;</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>And when she speaks her voice sounds like a birdsong.'&nbsp;</i></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Content&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The story is of a schoolboy who falls in love on his first day of school and craves for attention of his girl. During the course of time he understands her interest in birds and starts seeing them differently. All for the love he possesses for her.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is a story of recognizing the love you posses for a person and putting efforts in understanding her likes and dislikes. The book also gives a message of kindness and internal beauty. It is a beautiful, innocent story told with some great messages.The story and the illustrations compliment each other. The story is as much in the words as it is in the sketches.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Language&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The language is quite simple. Author possesses an innocence in the narration. It is also lyrical at times when the boy describes the girl. The entire narrative is lingering sweet.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Good points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover page is beautiful. One of the best I have seen this year. The characters are quite innovative and the portrayal, simplistic. The content is short and sweet, flavor added by the author with narration.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bad points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The story ended quick. A sweet story like this leaves you wishing there was more.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Overall&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">This book is a good product. The story can be read over and over again.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Who do I recommend this to?&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">This book is for those who like to read beautiful books. Those who appreciate short and sweet stories are also going to love this one.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Quotable quotes</h3><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: justify;">I don't want to take my costume off - I am a bird.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The worst is when it rains. I smell like wet dog.&nbsp;</div></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="text-align: justify;">My toy cars, soccer and all the rest don't seem important.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">And i don't look at birds the same way I did before.</div></blockquote><div><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAlCHTdABQI" target="_blank">Book Trailer</a></h3></div><div><i>I received an ARC of this book from the publishers via Netgalley. The review is my own, entirely uninfluenced.</i>&nbsp;</div></div>
