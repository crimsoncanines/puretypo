<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">2016 has been a great bookish year for me. One of the long lived bookish dreams was realized this year. I got myself a bookshelf. My own exclusive bookshelf! I can't keep my eyes and hands off it. It's beautiful..😍😍😍<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ouV0jsAKdrE/WGc-S98qGxI/AAAAAAAAEK0/SiLk1apo1Fgyd8ZBU2RASES6iDI3MS8cgCLcB/s1600/IMG_7238.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ouV0jsAKdrE/WGc-S98qGxI/AAAAAAAAEK0/SiLk1apo1Fgyd8ZBU2RASES6iDI3MS8cgCLcB/s640/IMG_7238.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Apart from that I have also treaded into a variety of genre. I have come to realize that I do love fairy tales and happy endings. Literally! ☺☺☺ I read a couple of fairy tales this year and watched their movie adaptations. Cinderella from Disney is my favorite till date. I hope to nurture this side of me with more fairy tales the coming year. A beautiful part of fairy tales is illustrations.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I also got around reading some beautiful illustration books. '<a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/08/the-day-i-became-bird-by-ingrid.html" target="_blank">The day I became a bird</a>' is my all year favorite. 💖💖&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It has been a good year for poetry also. I have discovered many poets and may have rid myself of the fear of poetry. It does no longer feel like an armed territory. Amazing people at 'Andrew McMeel' are definitely to thank for. 😌😌&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I also read some Indian authors and maybe shed a bit of repulsion towards them. Sadly I do not recall any memorable book by an Indian author.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Of course, my love of history and historical fiction has led me to a number of books on Tudors. I finally got around reading <a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/12/the-red-queen-by-philippa-gregory.html" target="_blank">Philippa Gregory</a> and decided I don't like her. 🙈🙈&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It has not been a great year for non fiction though. So I resolve to read more non fictions in the coming year. And more classics. Classics had also taken a back seat this year.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have also made a pact with myself that I am not going to force-read a book even though I am not enjoying it. The ever growing book piles and kindle library does not allow it. Hence the creation of DNF section. I have decided to DNF books that I do not like instead of reading them forcefully and giving a bad review.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our blog also turned a year older this November. We hosted a giveaway on Instagram for the same where three winners received a book of their choice! 🎉🎉&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">So, what was your year like? 🤓🤓🤓</div></div>
