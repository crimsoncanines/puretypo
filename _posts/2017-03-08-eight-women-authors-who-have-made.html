<div><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I am a woman. An imperfect but completely fabulous woman. I am me.</span></h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rFDMlbUL7I8/WL-iWpNUvmI/AAAAAAAAERQ/g6Enmoi45MgXjvFwgjJAqDJAVV-QtkxYACLcB/s1600/IMG_8649.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rFDMlbUL7I8/WL-iWpNUvmI/AAAAAAAAERQ/g6Enmoi45MgXjvFwgjJAqDJAVV-QtkxYACLcB/s640/IMG_8649.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div><div><br /></div></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name='more'></a>Agatha Christie</h3><div>Though it was Sir Arthur and Enid Blyton who introduced me to my most loved genre,<a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/09/the-mirror-crackd-from-side-to-side-by.html" target="_blank"> Agatha Christie</a> is one author who's books I hoard without thinking twice. Whether it's Ms. Marple, or Poirot, her writing has you breezing through most of her books. Her writing is simple and easy to understand and keeps one engaged. She sure has a gift for writing mysteries- which make her one of the most loved Authors of all time.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ali smith </h3><div><a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/10/autumn-by-ali-smith.html" target="_blank">Ali smith</a> is an author like no other. I happened to read her first book last year when it came out around the EU referendum. Such maybe the timing or such the talent that the author was able to separate the soul from the body and dissect it stripping each fiber of its two faced covering. The fine writing mixed with beautifully jumbled reflective thoughts which gives a tale like tone to her book is out of ordinary. You cannot get enough of Ali smith. </div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Arundhati Roy </h3><div>A feminist and a word player by her own right, <a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2015/12/the-god-of-small-things-by-arundhati-roy.html" target="_blank">Arundhati Roy</a> tells a story which has to be told, moulding the language to make it her own is her craft. She has always had a message in her writing with a unfailing ache. She graced us with a Booker and we wait for another as her new book releases in the first half of this year.&nbsp;</div><div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Enid Byton</h3><div>Enid Blyton is the author who I'll always be grateful to. Like most schools (or was it just mine?) We had rows and rows of books by her. She is one of the most loved children's books' Author- all for the right reasons. Whether it's mystery or the surreal world of toys , she could weave a web of words that truly has one bewitched. From being forced to read in the appointed "library hour" to sneaking to the library at every opportunity, she has and will remain one of my most favorite Authors of all times.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Harper Lee  </h3><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div>People generally see what they look for and hear what they listen for.</div></blockquote><div><a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2015/12/to-kill-mocking-bird-by-harper-lee.html" target="_blank">Harper Lee</a> has always been an inspiring soul to me. Her long lasting words of wisdom have created an impact on me that cannot be erased. The two novels written by her about the discrimination prevailing in this world which also combines the results of ones conscience and mind, ones attachment to his or her roots, has made me see the world and the people in it in a new light. Her writing, although simple, has helped me realise that not every situation is what it seems to be until you see it from the other person's point of view.  </div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Slyvia Plath  </h3><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div>I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead; I lift my eyes and all is born again.</div></blockquote><div>The first line from her poem, 'Mad Girl's Love Song', Sylvia Plath had me at it. She is an epitome of courage to me. A courage that fought to stand the workings of the mind which was clouded with a love so deep and disillusioned, that it eventually gave away. Her writings helped me gain an insight into the past, during the WWII. Most of her poems are based on it and on her own tangled mind and thoughts. Her intelligence combined with the depth of her passionate heart is what makes her an extraordinary woman to me. I will always go back to reading her poems because every line in them gives me a little bit more courage to face this world.  </div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Jane Austen  </h3><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div>Angry people are not always wise.&nbsp;</div></blockquote><div>Jane Austen's novels mark my journey into the world of classic literature. I remember picking up a copy of Pride and Prejudice as a teenager and wondering what the world used to be like, after reading a couple of pages. Her portrayal of the different social classes of the British had me curious at the ways of a woman's life, the various sacrifices she is entitled to make and the courage she requires to face them. The humorous and outrageous way of her characters had me thoroughly enjoy the novel, after which I couldn't stop myself from reading the rest of her books.</div><div><div><br /></div></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Lang Leav</h3><div><div>An author I discovered through the Internet, Lang is a poetess who reminded me how much I loved poetry. Her writing is simple, and yet deep and very relatable. She writes about love, life and women- all the things that I totally reckon with. Her books also come with beautiful illustrations by her, making the books all the more unique. </div><div>You don't have to read intense, complicated lines (an idea often associated with poetry) when it comes to her work. She writes as little as 3 lines, and still leaves you thinking.</div></div></div><div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Margaret Atwood&nbsp;</h3><div>Margaret Atwood has known to be an author with a vision. Her hauntingly resonating book '<a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/09/the-handmaids-tale-by-margaret-atwood.html" target="_blank">The Handmaid's Tale</a>' has made a comeback and not for the right reasons. She is almost like a soothsayer. Her latest novel '<a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/11/hag-seed-by-margaret-atwood.html" target="_blank">Hag-Seed</a>' has made it to Baileys long list! This one is not to be missed!&nbsp;</div></div></div>
