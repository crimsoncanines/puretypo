<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Arrival is one of the movies I had been looking forward to this December. The concept seemed a lot different from other alien/space movies I have watched earlier. And I must say, it was worth the wait.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ooQ3tmUl6-0/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ooQ3tmUl6-0?feature=player_embedded" width="485"></iframe></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Let me begin with the highlight of the entire movie, the plot. The plot is completely stunning. Unlike other alien movies this one does not portray the inconclusive war between humans and residents of other planets, thus preventing them from being the bad guys. On the contrary the movie dwells on the possibility of them coming to earth seeking our help.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Now this maybe a little hard to believe coming from a face which is far more advanced than us. But there is a possibility right? The entire movie concentrates on them helping the humans learn their language which might be instrumental in us learning about the future. Their communication evokes the idea of not seeing time as a linear entity but as multidimensional. The plot is mind boggling that way.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The cinematography justifies the entire plot and the actors more so. The female lead especially is just stunningly convincing. It is a journey through her eyes. Towards be end she has to decide if she wants to do the things same way when she knows the future already. That's a tough one. The movie compels you to think the same.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It takes one quite a while to understand what's happening in the story but when you do we cannot help but applaud the shear genius of the plot.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Since the highlight of the movie is it's plot I would definitely want to read the short story it is inspired from. The first of short story collection from Ted Chiang's book called 'The Story of Your Life And Others' is exactly what you are looking for.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I know how I want to spend my kindle credits now.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Watch the movie. It's brilliant!</div></div>
