<div><div><a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2015/12/love-and-misadventure-by-lang-leav.html" target="_blank">My first ever Lang Leav book</a> was a present to me. After a little procrastination I read it. And thus began my love for poetry. I do not call myself a poetry geek. But what I am, is a lover of beautiful words that seem like they are everything you will ever need to hear. It is this love that keeps bringing me back to Lang Leav. The new book by Lang Leav is all about romanticizing  the universe of you and me, of us.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2npGPSwCFIs/V62vp4vJE5I/AAAAAAAAD5Q/gSLBg98DNmQQa5b7f3sgv7bWi7jt7y0_QCLcB/s1600/IMG_2749.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2npGPSwCFIs/V62vp4vJE5I/AAAAAAAAD5Q/gSLBg98DNmQQa5b7f3sgv7bWi7jt7y0_QCLcB/s640/IMG_2749.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cover page&nbsp;</h3><div>Every book by the author has its own language. On the cover is a beautiful illustration of the author herself. The cover is a shade of pink with cursive white lettering. The cover as usual is simple and elegant. The back cover contains a line from inside the book which says <i>'he and I collided like two predestined stars and in that brief moment I felt what it was like to be immortal'</i>. Kudos to the publishers 'Andrews Mcmeel Publishing'.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Content&nbsp;</h3><div><div>We, as humans, are dreamy. We get stuck in the humdrum of life and monotony of surviving but we dream of stars. These stars when stationary form traces of imageries. And when they break we close our eyes for a wish.</div><div>We, as humans, have all romanticized the universe. Sun, moon, stars, Jupiter and the space. Lang Leav has revisited the romanticism clung to the universe in her new collection. She has explored the joy of love, the sorrow of loneliness, the vacuum of losing the ones you love; in all different forms. Some poems are deep as the sea and some are just lyrical, overwhelming your heart like a longing. Some of these poems are just rhyming bits, a little childish.&nbsp;</div><div>There are people in the book who are floating in space, around Jupiter, watching the waves of the ocean, wanting to uncover the blanket of stars and accumulate them to quantify the love they have for someone.</div><div>There are some, just lines, that make you delve into them like everything in the world can wait.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Language</h3><div>The poems are very dreamy, lyrical, as they usually are. They are very simple to understand or they need not be understood. Just enjoyed.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Good points&nbsp;</h3><div>The book cover is just beautiful. I plan to pre-order my copy right away. The content is 'out of the universe'. The poems are just brilliant. Some slightly better than the best ones in the book. There is an illustration by the author at the beginning which is, again, beautiful.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bad points&nbsp;</h3><div>I am having some trouble here. But let me just say, I was expecting more illustrations from the author this time around too. Was a little disappointed here.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Overall</h3><div>Lang Leav lives up to all the expectations. This book is just brilliant!</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Who do I recommend this to&nbsp;</h3><div>This book is for all those who like good writing. For all the dreamy ones!<br /><br />Pre-order your copy <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Universe-Us-Lang-Leav-ebook/dp/B01HHJ7BEE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471001974&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+universe+of+us" target="_blank">here</a></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Quotable quotes</h3></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Choose Love&nbsp;</b>My mother once said to me there are two kinds of men you'll meet. The first will give you the life you want and the second will give you the love you desire. If you're one of the lucky few, you will find both in one person. But if you ever find yourself having to choose between the two, then always choose love.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>When</b><br />When did you stop caring? he asked.<br />When did you start noticing? she replied.</blockquote><div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Lover's Paradox</b> Tell me that story again - the one where the world ends how it began with a by who loves a girl and a girl who loves a boy. And she is deaf and he is blind and he tells her her loves her over and over and she writes him every day but never hears a thing back.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">From <b>'Time Stands Still'</b> In cemeteries<br />of memories<br />our love will lie<br />in caskets.<br />My time with he<br />an eternity -<br />neither present<br />nor future<br />can past it.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">From <b>'All I Ask'<br /> </b>Stay''til our present<br />slips into the past-<br />it is all that I ask.</blockquote><span style="text-align: justify;"><i>I&nbsp;received&nbsp;this book from the publishers via Netgalley.
