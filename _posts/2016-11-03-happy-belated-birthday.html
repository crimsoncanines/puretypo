We are a tad late , but here we are! Seems like this month saw the birth of many poetical geniuses. Here are our four favorite masters from the literary world , who we absolutely adore. <br /><h3>E.E. Cummings (October 14, 1894)</h3>This American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright is remembered as an eminent voice of 20th-century English literature. He has written about&nbsp; 2,900 poems; two autobiographical novels; four plays; and several essays. He is also responsible for producing some fine drawings and paintings. The poems&nbsp; and quotes from the legend make him a favorite amongst people of all ages. <br /><blockquote>To be nobody but <br />yourself in a world <br />which is doing its best day and night to make you like <br />everybody else means to fight the hardest battle <br />which any human being can fight and never stop fighting.</blockquote><br /><blockquote>Lady, i will touch you with my mind.<br />Touch you and touch and touch<br />until you give<br />me suddenly a smile,shyly obscene<br />(lady i will<br />touch you with my mind.)Touch<br />you,that is all,<br />lightly and you utterly will become<br />with infinite care<br />the poem which i do not write.</blockquote><h3>Oscar Wilde (October 16, 1854)</h3>One of the finest minds in the world of Literature , he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He has delivered many masterpieces like <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&nbsp; ,&nbsp; The Importance of Being Earnest</em> and has also written beautiful short stories like <em><a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/03/the-happy-prince-other-tales-by-oscar.html" target="_blank">The Happy Prince and Other Stories</a></em> that are meant for kids but appeal to all age groups. <br /><blockquote>Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.</blockquote><blockquote>I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying. </blockquote><blockquote>The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.</blockquote><h3>Sylvia Plath (October 27, 1932)</h3>Sylvia Plath was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer. She is one of the most influential female writers of all times. She has an intriguing way of writing that is her most remembered characteristic. She was married to fellow poet Ted Hughes&nbsp; but they separated later on.&nbsp; Plath was clinically depressed for most of her adult life and died by committing suicide in 1963.<br />Plath is considered responsible for the growth of&nbsp;&nbsp; confessional poetry and is best known for her two published collections, <em>The Colossus and Other Poems</em>, and <em>Ariel</em>. She also wrote <em>The Bell Jar</em>, a semi-autobiographical novel published shortly before her death. <br /><blockquote>If you expect nothing from somebody you are never disappointed.</blockquote><blockquote><br />And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utterâ€” they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long.</blockquote><blockquote><br />I desire the things that will destroy me in the end.</blockquote><h3>John Keats (October 31, 1795)</h3><br />He was one of the most influential&nbsp; members of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley, despite his work having been in publication for only four years before his death.<br />Although his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved&nbsp; of all English poets , inspiring many after him to write sensuous love filled poetry that could turn your heart into a puddle even at this time and age.<br /><blockquote>Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?</blockquote><blockquote>I have been astonished that men could die martyrs<br />for their religion--<br />I have shuddered at it,<br />I shudder no more.<br />I could be martyred for my religion.<br />Love is my religion<br />and I could die for that.<br />I could die for you.<br />My Creed is Love and you are its only tenet.</blockquote>
