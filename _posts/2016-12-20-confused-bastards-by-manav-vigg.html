<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Indian literature scenario has changed completely with the arrival of new age author's who want to write something personal in their own way. One such author is Manav Vigg. Juggling between his day job and a writing career, he has presented a fine work of fiction. This book is going to agitate the intellectual book lovers and entertain others.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IA--nhaay3o/WFi-Ghcpz0I/AAAAAAAAEKA/kQ7L63EBUZkqOR-4E36WaJT541VQfcbRwCLcB/s1600/IMG_6151.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IA--nhaay3o/WFi-Ghcpz0I/AAAAAAAAEKA/kQ7L63EBUZkqOR-4E36WaJT541VQfcbRwCLcB/s640/IMG_6151.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cover page&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover page of any book plays a huge role in the presentation. It not only gives a good image to the book but also helps in the sales. The cover page is generally ignored when it comes to new age Indian literature.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The publishers have understood the importance of the cover and I am glad they did. The minutest details are kept in mind while designing it, save the spine which is quite boring against the peppy wiry cover page.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Definitely, a job well done.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Characters&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The characters of the book are not very different from people you meet everyday. They are all frustrated with their lives.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Akash is the son of an IAS officer. He hates the double standards and wants to run away from it. He is a rebel but he loves his family too. Vivek used to be a nerd who topped all the top colleges in India only to fail in his relationships. And there is Jai who's middle-class upbringing is stopping him up from following his own heart. He is a person who is so scared of tripping and falling that he doesn't even take a step.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Content&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The story is about three friends who break free from the corporate perks to start a venture of their own. While Aakash sees it as his life long dream the others are influenced and then pushed into it by others. Reluctantly they decide to start an online platform where the normal crowd vents out their frustrations through videos.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">As much as the idea sounds interesting, it lands them into&nbsp;great trouble leading to shutting off their website.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is a story of finding yourself and learning from your own mistakes. It can be a great book for those who want to start something on their own. The engaging plot and narration only makes it more interesting. The Hindi speaking public is going to love the narration.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The book is filled with quirky experiences and dialogues. The ardent feminist in me was offended at some parts but if you decide to ignore those portions the book is smooth. Towards the end the story may feel a bit draggy but it does not harm the book enough to not want you reading it.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Language&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The language adopted is quite simple with drum full of colloquial Hindi. The narration is splendid. The use of pauses and emotions makes it more relatable.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Good points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover design is thoughtful. It was a delight receiving a paperback of the book for review. The content is engaging. The characters are very relatable. But it is narration that takes the cake away. It flows like a dream.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bad points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The last part of the book may seem a little draggy. There are some female unfriendly lines too which does not go down well while reading.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Overall&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">It was fun reading this book. It shows that modern literature is not going to drains really.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Whom do I recommend this to&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">This book is for those who enjoy a good light read. This should be definitely read by all those who are thinking about a new venture.</div></div>
