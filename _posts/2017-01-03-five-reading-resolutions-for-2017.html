<div><div>Since my to-read list is never realised I have made another list of ambitions. It is slightly ( a lot ) different from the regular TBR lists. I have made a list of reading resolutions that I aspire to follow this year.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WUkQ1i8EOp0/WGuSV1chJkI/AAAAAAAAELc/re9ihlpNK48D-V-_jQ2iKnqQiK7wmu5zwCLcB/s1600/IMG_4572.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WUkQ1i8EOp0/WGuSV1chJkI/AAAAAAAAELc/re9ihlpNK48D-V-_jQ2iKnqQiK7wmu5zwCLcB/s640/IMG_4572.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><b><br /></b><b>Read a classic a month</b>: Yeah, that!&nbsp;</div><div><b>Read more regional authors this year</b>: <a href="http://www.merakipost.com/2016/12/ghachar-ghochar-by-vivek-shanbhag.html" target="_blank">Ghachar Ghochar</a> turned out to be good. Didn't it? Discover more regional writing.&nbsp;</div><div><b>Read more nonfiction</b>: Remember you enjoy nonfiction. They are not boring. They just require more patience and concentration.&nbsp;</div><div><b>DNF books that you don't like</b>: Seriously, there is nothing wrong in not completing the books that you do not like. DNF it. It will save you time to read the books that you actually like.&nbsp;</div><div><b>Limit buying new books</b>: Really look at your shelf and Kindle library before you jump ahead and buy new books!</div></div>
