Fatehpur Sikri is a stunning example of city planning which has been an inspiration for many architecture students and professionals alike---the set of buildings which were prime inspiration for Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore never fail to awe you. Fathehpur Sikri was later abandoned due to unavailability of water and thus a whole city was left to wither.

A masquerade surrounding this beautiful place, that houses a chequered chess board, where Akbar played with actual people as pawns, is meant to be a beautiful experience.

### Cover page

Akbar understood what no other monarch from of foreign origin ever did: To rule your subjects, you have to understand them better, and infuse with them. And hence the language of art and architecture evolved. He has Indo-Saracenic architecture and miniature paintings to his credit. The book is set in Fatehpur Sikri, at least in the beginning, and the cover art is a miniature painting.

One cannot help but appreciate the comedy that follows the masque which is ever present in the painting. Akbar wearing swanky shoes and holding a tape recorder is funny, to say the least. A good amount of research has gone into designing the cover which includes the painting as well as the dull grey background.

As a history lover, I am delighted to have seen such thoughtful cover design.

### Characters

Irwin is a traveller who is awestruck with Fatehpur Sikri. He is an artist. He writes novels. And that is the reason he is the chosen one. The ghost of Akbar dreads solitude. He misses the comfort of being a King, now that he is just an apparition. Akbar justifies his cruel means of justice. He demands air planes and what not. But he cannot have all of it. Not even water. Since he is a ghost and ghosts do not need much of it anyway.

### Content

Irwin is fascinated with Fatehpur Sikri. He loves the red stones and the breeze. He imagines what life would have been like; and then he meets Akbar's ghost. Akbar seems thirsty and lonely. He cannot move beyond Buland Darwaza. Hence he seeks the friendship of Irwin, a novelist whom he mocked for the art earlier.

Irwin obliges. He promises the King to put him in a story and take him to places but for that the King will need to do what Irwin asks. Move as he says and stop likewise.

This begins the strange journey of Zelaldinus.  

The book is a masque. It is a great mix of history, fiction, magical realism and political commentary. The author talks about Akbar. His education (or the lack of it). He gives us a glimpse of the court life and the special place Jalal has for the jewels of his court, especially Tansen. It is a meeting of history with the future and the comedy that follows. The lyrical prose and poetry-like passages are the highlights of the book. You sing and dance your way into the world with appropriate background noises.

The dreamlike events transpire into political message swiftly. A lover wishes he shaved before he met the love of his life. He wonders if he will find a barber in their country only to realise *why wouldn't he*---it's the same bloody country! The past meets the present, and wonders why there are borders when the entire land is one. Trains do not go to another country. Maybe Jalal could take a plane, but is it that simple?

### Language

This is not the prettiest part of the review. The language is TOUGH! It tests your patience! The language is like this high class mistress with social grace that you wish you could be Friends with but the class difference makes you wary.

There were words... difficult words; words that would make you keep running for a dictionary.

The poetry and prose have a beautiful lyrical balance. Random capitalization and eloquent narration make drama more desirable. These were a joy to read but the alien words killed it. Imagine coming across small pebbles in a delicious biryani that you really want to eat. You take them out patiently in the beginning, but then eventually start swallowing them.

### Good points

The cover design is thoughtful. The content is dreamlike. The setting is beautiful.

### Bad points

The language is difficult to understand. It may take more than one reading to understand the book entirely.

### Overall

I am glad to have come across this book. This is my first masque. I look forward to reading similar literature in future. I wish to see this performed on stage someday.

### Whom do I recommend this to

This book is for those who like experimental literature.
