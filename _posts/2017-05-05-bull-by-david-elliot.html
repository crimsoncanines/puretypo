<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">I prowl&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; The senseless alleys&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the maze</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the darkness&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And asphyxiating&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Solitude.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">There used to be a monster. Half man and half bull. Often ridiculed, he became the face of the evil. Then came a prince who slayed the monster and everyone lived happily ever after. It is quite heard of Greek myth. Goodness triumphs over evil and that's how a great tale is born which is told over and over to the generations to come. But what happens when the evil side is given a voice.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">David Elliot has done a wonderful work in this retelling of the tale of Minotaur.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zj2q3_naZro/WCf7oPMUbOI/AAAAAAAAEIM/us_07e8lhnYY3XpKXQTtNIt21w-hi-NZwCLcB/s1600/IMG_5779.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zj2q3_naZro/WCf7oPMUbOI/AAAAAAAAEIM/us_07e8lhnYY3XpKXQTtNIt21w-hi-NZwCLcB/s640/IMG_5779.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cover page</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover contains the illustration of a bull which, no doubt, is Minotaur. Inside the face of the bull is the nursery that Asterion sings. The idea to keep the cover page simple is lovely. The slight glimpse of different narrative style in the book is interesting. The composition is great. &nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Characters&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The book is essentially the story of Asterion or Minotaur as we all know it. But each character is given a voice of his own.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The sea god Poseidon is offended by a deed and he decides to punish. He is naughty and proud. He is a god and he knows it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Minos is the king of Crete and half father of Minotaur. Pasiphae is the wife of Minos. She is also the bearer of the animosity between Minos and the God of the&nbsp;sea. There are several other characters which are mentioned in the myth too, each serving their part well. All the characters are great epic.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Content&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">It is the story of the non-winners in a mythological tale. This is what makes the story extraordinary.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Minotaur here is given a chance to narrate his side of the&nbsp;story. The book&nbsp;begins with the pride of Poseidon and anger of Minos. Poseidon, when disrespected, casts a spell of Pasiphae as a result of which she fornicates with a bull. This unusual copulation gives birth to Asterion. Pasiphae is advised to throw the child off the cliff or into the ocean, but the mother's affection does not allow her. Asterion lives but his life is a living hell. He does not make friends. Hell, he cannot even talk because of his thick lips. He grows up to modified nursery rhymes and self-loathing.&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">Mommy had a little calf.<br />Little calf.<br />Little calf.<br />Mommy has a little calf.<br />His nose is black as tar.&nbsp;</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">The entire book reveals the depressing side of Asterion's story, even though the myth remains the same.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Language&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The way the story is written is the highlight of the book. The book originally meant for teenage reading is sure to become a sensation among other age groups too. The bluntness and pride of Poseidon, the anger of Minos, the helplessness of Pasiphae and the self-hatred of Asterion is aptly described.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The poetic narration is catchy. It keeps the story rolling and helps you understand the temperament of each character. There is a mix of literary tools used, which convey the skill possessed by the author.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Adriane, Minotaur's sister promises the Bull that there is a plan. The thrill is revealed in one word in each page. The spaces are used in narration with panache. The thrill and the sorrow are aptly expressed with the spacing amongst each word and sentence.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is definitely the best-narrated books I have read in a while.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Good points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover is beautiful. It is definitely one to own hard copy of. The characters are unique, we all know. But here they are quite relatable. The content is from the perspective of the losers. It is definitely to watch out for. But it is the narration that takes the cake away. A book which is narrated well makes a mark on the readers for life. This one surely has done the job well.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bad points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The length is short. The book finishes soon. It leaves you wishing for more. But isn't it with all great books?&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Overall&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">This is definitely one of the best books I have read this year.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Whom do I recommend this to&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">This is for those who like a&nbsp;great narration. Those who like the retelling of classic tales are going to enjoy it too. I recommend it to all the readers alike. This one is not to be missed.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Quotable quotes&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Poseidon</b>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">What?<br />You think a god should be more refined?<br />All touchy-feely?<br />No bump and grind?<br />Never uncouth?<br />Pure of mouth?<br />Pure of heart?<br />Never belch<br />Or swear<br />Or scratch himself<br />Or fart?<br />Never<br />Bawdy<br />Raunchy<br />Racy<br />Rude?<br />News flash:<br />You don't want a God.<br />You want a prude.&nbsp;</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Asterion</b>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">I'd fly away. I"d leave them all behind.<br />Then they'd look up.<br />Instead of down on me.&nbsp;</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Asterion</b>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">I watch Androgeos and try<br />To be like him.<br />But a rock can never fly.<br />A stone can't swim.<br />Poseidon<br />I'm talkin' 'bout physics.<br />If it goes up, baby,<br />It's comin' down.&nbsp;</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Adriane</b>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">There's danger in sanity.&nbsp;</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Poseidon</b>&nbsp;</div><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: justify;">Along with that sorry hive<br />Of thirteen sacrificial goats<br />Don't tell me.<br />I know: Since I said hive<br />I should call it bees.<br />But I'm Poseidon.<br />I do what I please:<br />Call heaven a hell,<br />A ceiling a floor.<br />So I mix my metaphors,<br />Grin and swallow.<br />I'm Poseidon. Not Apollo.</blockquote><i>I received an ARC of the book from the publisher. The opinion is my own, completely uninfluenced.&nbsp;</i></div>
