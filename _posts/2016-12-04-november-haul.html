<p>I’m sure most of you reading this can relate to the feeling of not having enough books to read which keep you company every other day, having become a vital part of your being and to go through a phase of the hoarder syndrome every now and then (guilty pleasures I say!) </p> <p>The month of November has been that way for me off lately. Finally got my hands on some interesting reads, some of which have been on my wish list for quite a long time and some of which have been recommendations by fellow bibliophiles.  <p><i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> and <i>Crime and Punishment </i>by Fyodor Dostoevsky are of the genres I’ve always wanted to acquaint myself with. And then comes <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra, </i>which I figured would be the best one to start exploring Nietzsche’s work.  <p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RAbqQtOw1pU/WEPIdOmNPuI/AAAAAAAAR9c/Cr2Q99fH2fg/s1600-h/Nov%252520Haul%25255B4%25255D.jpg"><img title="Nov Haul" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="Nov Haul" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SbLnkgMNuY4/WEPIeGLDwcI/AAAAAAAAR9g/2Co5qEpyJqw/Nov%252520Haul_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="648" height="409"></a>  <p>The next set of books which I have wanted to read for a long time but haven’t been able to and therefore haven’t got myself to sit through the movies either are <i>The Clockwork Orange </i>by Anthony Burgess and <i>Lolita </i>by Vladimir Nabokov<i>.</i> It has seriously taken me quite a lot of effort to keep myself from watching this particular thriller though. And talking about thrillers there’s <i>In Cold Blood </i>by Truman Capote. Having gifted a copy of it to a friend of mine (thanks to her staying away from the city, I didn’t fall prey to the urge of keeping it to myself but ordered two copies instead), this story has always got me fascinated and I’m waiting to read it all.  <p>Murakami’s <i>The Wind up Bird Chronicle </i>is the next one, and yes thanks to another friend of mine, an intense blogger and bibliophile, I was introduced to Murakami’s work with the Norwegian Wood after which it’s no stopping to get your hands on his novels. Albert Camus’ <i>The Stranger, </i>which I finally did add to my library after reading A Happy Death, had me thinking for a couple of days about his call of the meaning of life (This post is a little too late since the review of The Stranger is going to be up soon).  <p>Then there’s my first travel novel <i>On The Road </i>by Jack Kerouac and lastly <i>Mottled Dawn</i> by Saadat Hasan Manto which is a collection of short stories revolving around the Partition. Gripping right? So that’s the deal for the next couple of months to come.  <p>Be awesome. Be a book nut!</p>
