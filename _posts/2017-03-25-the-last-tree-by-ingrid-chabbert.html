<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">There was once a child who had grown up listening to stories, haven't they all. But this child is special in more than one ways. He has grown up listening to stories of his grandfather growing up amongst lots of trees and grass. He hears about rolling on the grass and flying kites. But he can't do that by himself.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is a story of future.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-znX1CP9jOTs/WCf7B6NQAkI/AAAAAAAAEII/QMU2zgY7F14HaH04hQ_7mxY0PjiK-5KdQCLcB/s1600/IMG_5756.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-znX1CP9jOTs/WCf7B6NQAkI/AAAAAAAAEII/QMU2zgY7F14HaH04hQ_7mxY0PjiK-5KdQCLcB/s640/IMG_5756.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><br /><h3><a name='more'></a>Cover page</h3>The cover page is an illustration of two kids inside a concrete jungle. It is a scene from inside the story. It is apt and beautiful.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Characters&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The book is about a nameless boy somewhere is future who only hears about greenery in the past. He wishes to walk on the tiny patch of grass that he has to walk a long way to get to. He often counts the blades of this patch but they are just reducing. It the story of this boy who wants to save the last tree of the earth.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Content&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The book is a futuristic look at the world we will be living in. The concrete jungle is going to be taken over by corporate cultures. Kids are only going to be hearing stories of the presence of huge trees and grasslands.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The concept is completely sold in this super short story by the author of the picture book. The book is about the boy who is living in such a world where he only hears stories of trees and grass.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">One day he comes across a sapling which might be the last tree of the world. This sapling is soon going to be uprooted to make space for a concrete structure. The story is of the boy saving the last tree of the world.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The writing is so full of innocence. As expected the author has done an equally good job with the book as she has with 'The day I became a bird'. The writing flows seamlessly.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The illustrations are the&nbsp;cherry on the cake. The illustration style is quite different from the earlier book. Here it is full of colors. Those who read the book are going to notice the newspaper illustration saying just 'bla bla bla'. It is not only hilarious but apt. The child is not going to understand the text either way. The illustrator gracefully includes the calendar into the bicycle ride where the boy is dreaming of the sapling growing to be a huge tree.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The author and illustrator form a great team together.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Language</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">Language is simple. It flows seamlessly through the story. The childlike innocence is quite evident in the writing.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Good points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover page is beautiful. The character is amazing to read about. The story is sweet and positive. The illustrations compliment the ever sweet narration.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bad points&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">Again, I felt the story ended quickly. I wish I could enjoy it for a little more time.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Overall&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">It is a beautiful picture book, definitely, a must read.&nbsp;</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Whom do I recommend this to&nbsp;</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">This is for all those who like to see the positive side of life. Those who enjoy children's literature are going to love this one too.&nbsp;</div></div>
