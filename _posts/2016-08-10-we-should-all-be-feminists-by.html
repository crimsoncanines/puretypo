<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">'Gender matters everywhere in the world. And I would like today to ask that we should begin to dream about the plan for a different world. A fairer world. A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how to start: we must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently.'  The book is an adaptation of a TED talk given by the author some time back. She is a men loving, make up wearing, fun and happy feminist. The author has compiled her thoughts on feminism in this short book. It is short but definitely differentiates feminists from pseudo feminists.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JsHG1Nxgmkg/V6NJuhJ7hSI/AAAAAAAAD4E/NrlOZUnL3aU4G3D6CD53Wewf9FiNneCPQCLcB/s1600/FullSizeRender.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JsHG1Nxgmkg/V6NJuhJ7hSI/AAAAAAAAD4E/NrlOZUnL3aU4G3D6CD53Wewf9FiNneCPQCLcB/s640/FullSizeRender.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Cover&nbsp;</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The cover art is very simple. It is some pattern with the name and title of the book displayed in bold. This is a good cover to be kept in the shelf.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Content&nbsp;</h3></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">The book contains the talk given by the author on TED. The author touches all the topics which lead to feminism. The need of it today and lack of it ages ago. She also talks about how men have become the standard by which even women are judged. The author throughout makes it clear that men and women are two different genders. But to associate one gender to a chore is unfair. She says,'what if, in raising children, we focus on ability instead of gender? What if we focus on Interest instead of gender?'&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is also an argument of calling for human rights rather than feminism since feminism is also human right. The author asserts the importance of specificity in the subject.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Largely the author demands social change from men and women alike. The text is rich in logic and facts. The everyday behavior is well spoken in the talk by the author.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Language&nbsp;</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The language is very clean and to the point. The author does not like beating around the bush and it very evident in the text. There is also a direct addressing of the issues in the book which clears most of the stigma attached to the word 'feminists'.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Good points&nbsp;</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The book is a great text in feminism. The author has addressed the issue head on. It is rich in observation. It is also a short read on the subject, for those who like to keep to the point.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Bad points&nbsp;</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The book read more like a talk than a work of literature. It is from a talk on TED but even some change in text was expected.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Overall&nbsp;</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The book is an excellent read on feminism. Must read for those who are interested in the subject.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Whom do I recommend this to&nbsp;</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This book is for those who want to learn about feminism but also want to be saved from false opportunistic voices. It is a great short read for those who like to keep things short and to the point.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Quotable quotes&nbsp;</h3></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">So I decided I would now be a Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men. At some point I was a Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men And Who Likes To Wear Lip Gloss And High Heels For Herself And Not For Men.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">Our society teaches a woman of certain age who is unmarried to see it as a deep personal failure. While a man at a certain age who is unmarried has not quite come around to making his pick.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">Some people ask, 'why the word feminist? Why not just say you as a believer in human rights, or something like that?' Because that would be dishonest. Feminism is, of course, part of human rights in general- but to choose to use the vague expression human rights is to deny the specific and particular problem of gender.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">For centuries, the world decided human beings into two groups and then proceeded to exclude and oppress one group. It is only fair that the solution to the problem should acknowledge that.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">Culture does not make people. People make culture. If it is true that the full humanity of women is not our culture, then we can and must make it our culture.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes.&nbsp;</blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote class="tr_bq">My own definition of a feminist is a man or a woman who says,'Yes there's a problem with gender as it is today and we must fix it, do better.</blockquote></div></div></div>
