Incidentally, it was the same book I had been eyeing at Netgalley a few days prior. I immediately jumped at the opportunity to host the tour since it gave me a copy of the same book. I am glad I finally picked this up to host a tour and review. This is truly a great new year beginning.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><img src="https://exportwriter.zoho.com/writer/remoteImage.do?imgurl=29f6264530b6ce2aaffff35adc750747d09c424eb954b06fb97d71642dacb77ee754d5326b23165ad02709d2d814347c" /> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Lost Girls by Merrie Destefano&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Publication Date: January 3, 2017&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Publisher: Entangled Teen</b>&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Fight Club meets Black Swan—Rachel wakes up in a ditch to find she doesn’t remember the last year of her life, and that everything—including herself—is vastly different than she remembers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday, Rachel went to sleep listening to Taylor Swift, curled up in her grammy’s quilt, worrying about geometry.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today, she woke up in a ditch, bloodied, bruised, and missing a year of her life.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">She doesn’t recognize the person she’s become: she’s popular. She wears nothing but black.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Black to cover the blood.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">And she can fight.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tell no one.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">She’s not the only girl to go missing within the last year…but she’s the only girl to come back. She desperately wants to&nbsp;unravel what happened to her, to try and recover the rest of the Lost Girls.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">But the more she discovers, the more her memories return. And as much as her new life scares her, it calls to her.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Seductively. The good girl gone bad, sex, drugs, and raves, and something darker…something she still craves—the rush of&nbsp;the fight, the thrill of the win—something she can’t resist, that might still get her killed…&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The only rule is: There are no rules.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><img src="https://exportwriter.zoho.com/writer/remoteImage.do?imgurl=29f6264530b6ce2aaffff35adc750747d09c424eb954b06fb97d71642dacb77e48635b41e9742f0c0ad8ab3edb2a3065" /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">CURRENTLY A FULL-TIME NOVELIST and magazine editor, Merrie Destefano’s next novel, LOST GIRLS, releases on January 3, 2017. Her other novels include AFTERLIFE and FEAST, both published by HarperCollins, and FATHOM, which was self-published. The editor of Victorian Homes magazine, she has also been the editor of American Farmhouse Style, Vintage Gardens, and Zombies magazine, and was the founding editor of Cottages &amp; Bungalows magazine.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">With 20 years experience in publishing, she worked for a variety of publishing/broadcasting companies that include Focus&nbsp;on the Family, The Word For Today, and PJS Publications (now Primedia). Besides editing and writing, her background&nbsp;includes print buying, writing/producing radio promos, directing photo shoots, developing new products, writing jacket copy&nbsp;for books, creating sales media packets and organizing direct mail campaigns.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Born in the Midwest, she currently lives in Southern California with her husband, two German shepherds, a Siamese cat&nbsp;and the occasional wandering possum. Her favorite hobbies are reading speculative fiction and watching old Star Trek&nbsp;episodes, and her incurable addiction is writing. She loves to camp in the mountains, walk on the beach, watch old movies, listen to alternative music—although rarely all at the same time.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1U1c0XOKaTs/WHJyiYU47VI/AAAAAAAAEMU/Fth1XOCmEiQgWeGfSV-OKC_4b84nX-2mgCLcB/s1600/IMG_7632.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="358" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1U1c0XOKaTs/WHJyiYU47VI/AAAAAAAAEMU/Fth1XOCmEiQgWeGfSV-OKC_4b84nX-2mgCLcB/s640/IMG_7632.JPG" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I am about 10% done with the book and already loving it!
