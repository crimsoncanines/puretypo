Sarah Anderson swept the illustration world with her comic strip illustration books. She is considered one of the best illustrators when it comes to funny and hilarious characters. Sarah Anderson draws herself and talks about women in general. She is funny and sassy. I am glad to have received the next book in the series. More so, because I can identify my emotions with her. Well, largely.

### Cover page

The cover page is utterly simple. There is a heading and an illustration of the author on the cover. While I was not very much drawn to the cover, I was not repulsed either. The composition is neat.

### Characters

The author talks about herself in the book (or draws). There is a room for other characters in her book but it is largely herself. The author is a ardent book lover, cat-lover, confused stylist, comfort junkie and a lot more. Each trait of the author is elegantly presented in hilarious illustration. The self mockery makes the author a much interesting person to know about.

### Content

As it happens with book of illustrations, the fun is in the illustrations. The draws herself in different situations. The book is collection of illustrations of simple things that bring little joys in life. The author is also a feminist by her own right.

### Language

Even though her illustrations say everything, the hilarious anecdotes do well to compliment the writing.

### Good Points

The content is just hilarious. It makes you regret finishing the book this soon.

### Bad Points

The book got text heavy towards the end. Also since, I am not a cat lover myself, I was not affected by pages after pages of cat love towards the end.

### Overall

Overall, it is a beautiful collection of illustrations. Every girl go through these at least once. It leaves you in a Big Mushy Happy Lump towards the end.

### Whom do I recommend this to

This is for all the women largely, and men. Those who enjoy funny illustrations once in a while are going to love this too.</div>
