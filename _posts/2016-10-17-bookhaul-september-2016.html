<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Yes, we are well into October, am late in posting this one! Better late than never right!? Considering the growing piles of unread books in my room, I really need to stop buying books (No, am just joking!). So , here is my very loved September haul!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, I decided to try and buy books around the theme for <a href="http://www.thebibliobox.com/" target="_blank">The Biblio Box</a>, as it helps me organize my book buying. This time around the theme was Classics, and so I decided to buy <em>Vinegar Girl</em>, which is a retelling of one of Shakespeare’s books. Apart from this, I bought the entire series of books that feature Anne, of <em>Anne of Green Gables</em>. This &nbsp;set of books by Puffin is simply adorable and was on my list for a very long time!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y4CT47IEejU/WAIluSduXTI/AAAAAAAAB54/DJywE-oZdHYwPMwxvWrbVW1IxUKVsyKIwCK4B/s1600/IMG_20160924_125603.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="520" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y4CT47IEejU/WAIluSduXTI/AAAAAAAAB54/DJywE-oZdHYwPMwxvWrbVW1IxUKVsyKIwCK4B/s640/IMG_20160924_125603.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The month of September also brought to me some lovely used books from UK, sent by a very dear friend.&nbsp;<em>Harvesting the heart, Rebecca, An impossible Marriage</em> were some among them.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The biblio box had&nbsp; <em>Elligible</em> (I already had one of the books they had in the box, hence I replaced it with this), <em>Hemingway in Love</em> and I upgraded it with <em>The Great Gatsby</em>- another book that I’ve been wanting for a while now!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VHbgoXRSHVI/WAIlyoCIdhI/AAAAAAAAB6A/qgv44B9Cf4IFyUUYYCy5dGgaR1-cGaNzgCK4B/s1600/IMG_20161007_230030.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="352" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VHbgoXRSHVI/WAIlyoCIdhI/AAAAAAAAB6A/qgv44B9Cf4IFyUUYYCy5dGgaR1-cGaNzgCK4B/s640/IMG_20161007_230030.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Apart from these, I received some interesting titles like <em>Dark Matter, Rau</em> etc for review from the Publisher,&nbsp; which have been getting amazing reviews from the readers. I also received two books from the authors themselves. One being, <em>The Memory of Lost Dreams </em>which is a dystopian novel&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other is <em>The Morning tree</em>- a retelling of a fairytale. Lastly, I finally WON A GIVEAWAY! (do the capital letters show my excitement enough!?)&nbsp; hosted by a friend and fellow blogger, I won the giveaway he hosted and got <em>Shattered Dreams</em>, and <em>All yours, stranger</em>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, September has left my room with a little hurricane of books that I am only too glad to clean up.</div></div>
