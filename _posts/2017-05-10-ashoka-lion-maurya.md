Ashok K. Banker is one of the pioneers that made mythological fiction popular amongst the young readers in India. This Ramayana and Mahabharata series is read and adored by plenty. Ashok K. Banker has now delved into historical fiction and what better subject to write about than the lion of Maurya itself.

Ashoka is a historical figure about whom more ilia unknown than there is known about. It was a pleasure holding the book on a historical icon by the author. Somehow the book failed to meet my expectations but it has in no way questioned the credibility of the author.

### Cover page

In his lifetime Ashoka fought a lot many wars and came to be known as the lion of Maurya. The cover page exploits the legendary battles and the figure of lion dramatizes the cover page. The colours are dull but the temperament is seen precisely. The cover page overall is on a better side. Not the best of the work but not horrific also.

### Characters

Ashoka is a prince like no other. He likes to fight in akhada to test himself. He is attentive, has lighting fast reflexes, measures two steps ahead, extremely emotional and love his family like any man should. Ashoka's disinterest in the throne sets him apart from his other brothers who would not hesitate to slaughter their own family members to keep the throne for themselves.

There are other characters in the book such as King Bindusara, Queen Shubhadrangi, queen mother, and Kautilya.

Each character has a part to play but they are not delved much deeper into. It is the story of Ashoka.

### Content

The story begins with a Lacchavi assassin entering the city of Pataliputra with a plan to execute the king. Ashoka enters an akhada to fight like a common man. During the course of time it is revealed that they were had set their feet in the state to assassinate the king. It is the story of Ashoka, his love for the family and country. It is his journey of bringing the offenders to their fate. His multiple faces are revealed throughout the book. The author describes the boy unlike how we have been told about before. He is not only a loyal student and a loving son but also a passionate lover who goes through a heart break quite early in life.

There are multiple aspects explored in the book which have not been talked about earlier such as incest and polygamy. The result of multiples marriages of the king on the family, etc.

The story can be challenged by many as more fictional than historical. And to justify himself the author begins with a dialogue where he calls 'history' a sexist phrase. History is not static and his attempt to write Ashoka's story is to explore possible happening. It may not be what a historical reader may like but those who enjoy a bit of drama with history are going to like the tale.

### Language

Narration is the strong arm of the book. The story telling makes the book more bearable. Sentences such as 'more gold in a Pataliputra's merchant's arse than in the vaults of any other city' to describe the city keep the readers engaged. Those who adore Ashoka as a ruler are going to love the descriptions of him by the author.

### Good points

The cover page is interesting. Ashoka as a character is interesting to read about. And so is Kautilya. The content is engaging. The narration is powerful.

### Bad points

The book is short. Right when the story starts getting interesting the book ends. It is far from actual history and it may annoy those who picked up the book looking for interesting history book by their favourite mythology writer.

### Overall

Overall it is a good book, not as good as expected.

### Whom do I recommend this to

This is for those who have not read anything on Ashoka before. Those who have may want to start clear of this one.
