<div><div>I could blame my love for stationery to the fact that I am an Architect. We work with varied mediums of art to convey our designs, so our love for papers, books, pencils, all things artsy is quite natural. So when I heard about a box dedicated to quirky minimalistic stationary, I had to try it!</div><div>Origin One store is a unique stationary box subscription that caters to people who love stationary and who dig minimalism! Their designs are classy, and they have a wide array of items like planners, notebooks, badges, stickers, postcards etc.</div><div>I tried the&nbsp; Mini-box, and it so happened that I ordered just in time to receive the Diwali box. The content was a surprise, and the wait for the box was killing me! I received the box around the dates that they had mentioned. It came in a courier bag that is customized for the company and screams ORIGIN ONE right from the start! It was then enveloped in a lovely colorful wrapper that protected the box underneath. The box again is stamped with their niche design, and thank god for the multi-layered packing, because the cover was slightly damaged&nbsp; due to transit, but the contents were perfectly safe.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-26VB0XL7hNM/WAdvF_ipRaI/AAAAAAAAB6k/_Efg8nOVNbQZ5mZ55kSCF1dXl02bxDg_gCLcB/s1600/IMG_20160930_160418.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-26VB0XL7hNM/WAdvF_ipRaI/AAAAAAAAB6k/_Efg8nOVNbQZ5mZ55kSCF1dXl02bxDg_gCLcB/s400/IMG_20160930_160418.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Coming to the content of the box, there was a chocolate (quite a surprise there!), a planner (its actually a checklist- something I absolutely need!) , and a small notebook. Apart from this, there was a&nbsp; stark&nbsp; white minimalistic coaster, two beautiful envelopes&nbsp; and a postcard, a badge with their logo, a couple of stickers with their logo, and a few cards about being eco-friendly and the like.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Overall</h3><div>Full points for packaging. The designs are definitely unique and appealing. The box is priced at Rs.1100/- inclusive of shipping. I felt its a bit over priced as about 40% of the content is just stickers and badges advertising their own brand.</div><div>Would I buy the box again ? Maybe not , but would I buy the products individually? Maybe I would!</div><div>They have a whole lot of products on their <a href="https://www.originone.in/" target="_blank">website</a>, and they have boxes in different sizes too.</div><div><br /></div></div>
