<div><div>Starting this month, we will be listing out birthdays of some of the Author’s we have read, want to read and have loved. The literary world is a mighty world with names known and unknown, and there might be many writer’s who’s work we may not encounter in an entire lifetime! But hey, lets get wishing already.</div><h3>Charles Bukowski </h3><div>One of those Authors born this month , and with whom most of us are acquainted with, mostly due to the memorable quotes brought to us, courtesy THE INTERNET. He happens to be on my TBR for this year. I have heard so much about his unique writing style that I cannot help but love his quotes and look forward to books by him. </div><blockquote><div>We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ― Charles Bukowski</div></blockquote><h3>John Green</h3><div><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3h9_efF3XTk/V78Ddb_ES9I/AAAAAAAABxk/6rkevSH_q3kcrG7rasyQWqcQH7vaYcDVwCK4B/s1600/14087729_10210760145384938_1133635196_o.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="266" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3h9_efF3XTk/V78Ddb_ES9I/AAAAAAAABxk/6rkevSH_q3kcrG7rasyQWqcQH7vaYcDVwCK4B/s400/14087729_10210760145384938_1133635196_o.jpg" width="400" /></a></div></div><div><div><br /></div></div><div>An author loved for this contribution to Young-Adult fiction. Green also born in August, is absolutely adorned by the younger bibliophiles in particular. Right from leaving us teary eyed with <em>The fault in our stars</em> to showing us a strange girl, and unusual relationships&nbsp; in a new light in <em>Finding Alaska</em>, he has given plenty to contemplate on. We sure look forward to all the other books that this young Author will be penning in the course of time. </div><blockquote><div>There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ― John Green, The Fault in Our Stars</div></blockquote><h3>Ray Bradbury</h3><div><div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XCG-290wiGQ/V78DZ_miemI/AAAAAAAABxc/a77cq_gJ1yEi3Vrx9VmREs7DLMCqxHvLgCK4B/s1600/14138988_10210760146104956_2053520091_o.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XCG-290wiGQ/V78DZ_miemI/AAAAAAAABxc/a77cq_gJ1yEi3Vrx9VmREs7DLMCqxHvLgCK4B/s400/14138988_10210760146104956_2053520091_o.jpg" width="320" /></a></div></div><div><div><br /></div></div><div>Remembered for his books like<i> Farenheit 451</i> and <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>, he left memorable pieces of writing for book lovers for a long time to come. Yet another book that I have on my shelves waiting to be read is <i>Farenheit 451</i>. Apart from this, many quotes by this Author born in August continue to be food for thought, and will be so for many more years. </div><blockquote><div>You must write every single day of your life... You must lurk in libraries and climb the stacks like ladders to sniff books like perfumes and wear books like hats upon your crazy heads... may you be in love every day for the next 20,000 days. And out of that love, remake a world.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ― Ray Bradbury</div></blockquote><div>Photo courtesy : <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gazala_jarofthoughts/" target="_blank">Gazala</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/veena___singh/" target="_blank">Veena&nbsp;</a></div></div>
