> This is a Meraki Post internal page, to help us with the common formatting guidelines, so as to ensure uniformity throughout the site. This page may not be relevant to you if you're a visitor.

Posts on this site are made using this beautifully simple lightweight markup language called *Markdown*. This is so that you can use any text editor (including the good old Notepad), to write posts.
