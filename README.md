## Jasper

This is a pure-Jekyll fork of [Typo](https://github.com/studiolampblack/typo), a fork of [Jasper](https://github.com/biomadeira/jasper), a port of Ghost's default theme [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper) for Jekyll inspired by [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper).

Typo (and Jasper) are great themes. Things are well-built, and Typo is typographically tuned. However, they're not "safe" Jekyll themes. When hosting your Jekyll site on GitHub Pages, GitHub runs the site with the `--safe` switch. Jasper and Typo have Jekyll plugins, which are not supported by GitHub Pages. So you need to build the site either locally or using Continuous Integration (such as Travis CI) and host it on GitHub.

Pure Typo is an attempt to ease this process. There's no need to build the site locally and push it to GitHub or use Continuous Integration&mdash;it all just works!

Besides, Jasper and Typo have limitations such as, the site would have to be single-author. If not, the site has to be bent a little to get it to play nice with multiple authors. Pure Typo has none of those limitations. Of course, some things aren't even close to being as beautiful as Jasper, but hey, choices and trade-offs.

## How to use it

### Deployment

**Important:**  For security reasons, Github doesn't allow plugins (under _plugins/) when deploying with Github Pages. This means:

**1)** that we need to generate your site locally (more details below) and push the resulting HTML to a Github repository;

**2)** built the site with [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) (with goodies from [jekyll-travis](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis)) automatically pushing the generated *_site/* files to your *gh-pages* branch.
 This later approach is the one I am currently using to generate the live demo.

For option **1)** simply clone this repository (*master branch*), and then run `jekyll serve` inside the directory. Upload the resulting *_site/* contents to your repository (*master branch* if uploading as your personal page (username.github.io) or *gh-pages branch* if uploading as a project page (as for the [demo](https://github.com/crimsoncanines/typo/tree/gh-pages)).

For option **2)** you will need to set up travis-ci for your personal fork. Briefly all you need then is to change your details in *[\_config.yml](_config.yml)* so that you can push to your github repo. You will also need to generate a secure key to add to your *[.travis.yml](.travis.yml)* (you can find more info on how to do it in that file). Also make sure you read the documentation from [jekyll-travis](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-travis). This approach has clear advantages in that you simply push changes to your files and all the html files are generated for you. Also you get to know if everything is still fine with your site builds. Don't hesitate to contact me if you still have any issues (see below about issue tracking).

### Author pages

As discussed [here](https://github.com/biomadeira/jasper/issues/3), in order to properly generate author pages you need to rename the field *categories* in the front matter of every post to match that of your *username* as defined in the *[\_config.yml](_config.yml)* file.
This probably means that with a bit of hacking you could in principle generate multiple author blogs. Check this [link](https://github.com/biomadeira/jasper/issues/10) for more on working with multiple authors...

## Issues and contributing

This install builds well with Ruby v2.1.1 and Jekyll v3.0.0. If you run into any problems please log them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/biomadeira/jasper/issues).
